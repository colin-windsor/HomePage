I have been deputising on the church organ ever since the 1960s at Steventon Church.
I was choirmaster at Goring Church for several years in the 1980s.  

<P>In May 2007 I begain playing on the second sunday of the month at St John's Whitchurch Hill. 
In October 2012 I became official organist, playing on the first and third Sundays at the lovely St Mary's 
Church by the river at Whitchurch. I retired after my 80th birthday with a splendid service
and party afterwards. 

Now I enjoy playing occasionally at Upton village church.
I might be available to play for 
occasional Sunday services, or other occasions.

<P>Mo and I play a <A HREF="eorgan/eorgan.htm">digital electronic organ</A> at home using some of 
the old Binns organ from Streatley Church.
