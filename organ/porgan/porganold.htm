<H1>Colin's single rank pipe organ built in 2011</H1>
<P><HR><FONT SIZE=4>
<B>The rank of stopped diapason pipes</B><BR>
It started sadly, one of our organist friends from Upton sadly died suddenly. We sang
every week with his wife, and one day as she was clearing out her loft she said,
"Would we like to have a set of old organ pipes?" I was not at all certain, but when she brought
me one and I had a blow on it, I was inspired. 
It was an old wooden stopped diapason.
It started with a nice "chuff" and carried on with the soft woody sound of the very best
chamber organs.  You could tell its age from the nice cursive script that graced some of
the pipes. Sadly not all the pipes sounded so good, or indeed sounded at all. 
<IMG SRC="porganpipes.jpg" ALT="The set of 54 pipes" ALIGN="LEFT">
For no obvious reason, some pipes just gave a woody hiss.
 It was possible that I may need some spares and
fortunately an advert in the <A HREF="http://www.eocs.co.uk">"Electronic Organ Constructers Society" </A>
magazine enabled me to buy a similar set. They proved most useful for spares.

<P>These pipes have the traditional organ range from C, two octaves below middle C,
to f<SUB>3</SUB>, two and a half octaves above middle C. The names and frequencies of the C's on the organ
are given in the table below, adapted from <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pitch_Table.png">Wikipedia </A>

<P><B>The physics of stopped diapason pipes</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="Porganphysics.jpg" ALT="A wavelength of sound, with open and stopped pipes" ALIGN="LEFT">
The speed of sound in air: <I>V=343.2</I> metres per second, is pretty fast, ~3 seconds for a kilometre, but musical frequencies
 are pretty high.
Middle C is <I>f=261.6 </I>cycles per second, for the standard tuning of <I>A=440</I>. Sound is a sinusoidal wave, 
and the wavelength for middle C is <span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span><I>=V/f=1312</I> mm.
The figure above shows how the pressure or amplitude of the sound wave changes with either time or space. It moves
along a <i>sine</I> wave which starts at a high positive amplitude, goes through zero to a negative amplitude,
and then back again to its starting amplitude. 
<IMG SRC="PorganmiddleC.jpg" ALT="Our Middle C stopped pipe" ALIGN="RIGHT">
In a stopped pipe, the amplitude at the stopped end must be zero, while
the amplitude at the fipple end is large. The length of the stopped pipe is then just one quarter of a wavelength,
or about one foot for middle C. The figure on the left shows the middle C pipe from the set against a foot ruler.
<IMG SRC="porganturbulence.jpg" ALT="Turbulent airflow around the labium: Photo from University of 
Eindhoven, Netherlands" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<IMG SRC="porganfipple.jpg" ALT="The lowest C pipe with the fipple taken apart" ALIGN="LEFT">

Air blowing over the fipple creates turbulence with periodic pressure variations. The sound from these travels
down the pipe, is reflected from the stopped end, and returns to the fipple. It the length of the pipe is such that
the round trip time corresponds with the frequency, then the pipe <I>resonates</I> or sounds.
If the pipe is "open", then the pressure variation at its end will be high and the pipe will be twice as long
for the same resonant frequency. But open pipes tend to have more harmonics and give a less sweet tone that the
pure flute-like tones from the stopped pipes.
<P>The important fipple part of the pipe is shown taken apart for the lowest pipe on the organ <I>C</I>.
The air comes in through the tube on the right, rises up to a thin "airway", which tapers at the upper
end to produce a wide jet of air directed at the "labium" - the sharp edge of wood placed a centimetre
or so away from the end of the jet. The photo to the right shows the ffrqe
ent air stream which 
provides the stimulus for the resonant sound.
 



<IMG SRC="porganmanual.jpg" ALT="The 54 key manual from the old Binns organ at Streatley" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<P><B>The old Binns keyboard from Streatley Church</B><BR>
This was a work of art in itself. Our tuner said that Binn's organs were built like a battleship.
Although over 100 years old there were no signs of wear. The keys appear to be real ivory, 
and all the shafts of the keys are cut from a single piece of wood so that any relative distortion should
disappear. Their alignment is from one pin near their centre, with the red felt washer, and one pin 
under the key itself with the blue washer. They make
the sideways movement very small. As the figure shows they extend from 
two octaves below middle C (or C in the Helmholtz notation) over four and one half octaves 
to the F two and a half octaves above middle C 
(or f<sub>3</sub> in this notation). The keyboard frame was just 800 mm across and 740 mm deep and this
determined the size of the organ frame.

<IMG SRC="porganframe.jpg" ALT="The open frame of the organ" ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>The oak organ frame from the forest of Belleme in Normandy</B><BR>
So often organs are wrapped up in beautiful cases. Until you open a door and have a look inside
the case you have no idea what is going on when you press a key. Peering round
inside the organ, you see all the pipes but they sit above a big windchest and that too
is tightly closed. The very place where the 
action that makes the pipe sound is placed is opaquely screwed up tight! 
I determined to make an organ without any case where all the pipes and all the action
would be visible. I would make a windchest with perspex sides so that you could see what 
was happening within its walls.

<IMG SRC="action.jpg" ALT="The organ from the back with pipes removed showing the action" ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>By a lucky chance a good friend who lived near our French house in Belleme came round
one evening with a whole load of lengths of rectangular section oak. Actually they were
rejects from the wood-yard where they were making oak kitchen work surfaces by gluing these pieces
together. They were really for firewood, but there were enough good lengths there for me
to plan the whole frame of the organ. It turned out to be one of the easier jobs to 
cut the good pieces to length, and screw them together to make a rigid frame on which the
keyboard could rest. The rejects and end bits that I cut off did indeed end up on the fire!

<P>The large flat surfaces of 1" oak veneer used for the base of the treadle board.
the reservoir chest, the top and music stand also have a history. They came from the wardrobe
doors of the three-piece suite I had as a 10-year old. They had had a 60-year use and it was touching
to use them again. 


<P><B>The simple action possible with a single rank organ</B><BR>
The average spacing of the keys on a standard keyboard is around 13.5 mm. The widths across our pipes
are always larger than this - from 17 to 125 mm. The conventional action for traditional organ construction is 
to make up a "roller board" that mechanically spreads out the action at the keys to the required spacing.
However if the keys are divided alternately into two sets, the average spacing of each set is
27 mm. This is sufficient wide for 19 mm outside diameter soft rubber pipe to be used for the airflow
to the pipes and that is the solution used here. The figure to the left shows the keyboard, and the wire 
connections into the windchest beneath the keyboard. Their are two rows of red flexible rubber pipes.
The 16 largest pipes from CC to E are held vertically
along the back and left side. They are blown by quite long rubber pipes connected to the
windchest. Most of the other pipes simply hang upside down from rubber tubes
underneath the windchest.  
<IMG SRC="sidepipes.jpg" ALT="The side of the organ with some pipes and rubber tubes in place" ALIGN=RIGHT>

<P><B>The windchest and palettes</B><BR>
The windchest is the central processor of a pipe organ. As each note key is pressed a stream of wind is sent 
to the appropriate pipe. This is done by a soft leather-coated "palette" being moved
to let the air out through a hole beneath it. The whole windchest is fed with air from a blower, so that the
air within it is under the wind pressure needed by the pipes. It needs to be leak-tight!

Conventionally when there are several ranks of pipes, 
there will be a matrix with the keys operating each note and  "sliders" operated by the stops opening each rank. 
This organ has only the single rank of pipes so that each palette opens a single hole and everything is simpler. 
The figure to the left shows the construction of the palettes. Vertical alignment is by a simple nail hammered into 
the back of each palette which enters into the set of horizontal holes drilled in the back wall of the windchest.  
Horizontal alignment is by a set of vertical upturned nails which travel inside holes drilled in each palette.
The leather and felts for each palette were from cut-off palettes from the old Binns organ. They varied in size from
24 mm square for the lowest notes to 14 mm square for the highest. The cup-hooks screwed into the end of the pallette
were connected through leather thongs to the wires from the keyboard.

<IMG SRC="palettes.jpg" ALT="The palettes in construction." ALIGN=LEFT>
<IMG SRC="windchest.jpg" ALT="The windchest in construction" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>The base of the windchest was solid oak 33 mm thick (from the old Binns organ). The back and one side were
solid but the other side, the top and the front were all made from 3 mm thick perspex sheet - it made all the
action nicely visible. A tricky point was the line of holes along the top front where the action wires passed out
of the windchest. About 0.6 mm enamelled copper wires were used, and these passed through 1 mm holes drilled 
in a strip of oak. It lost air, and small leather washers with a needle-point hole were needed to stop the leaks.   

<P><B>The foot and hand-operated bellows</B><BR>
Mo was always keen on a non-electric human-powered organ. Foot operated bellows are common enough on harmoniums
and on pipe organs long ago. They are usually indirectly operated by separate pedals but a simpler solution 
seemed to be a direct action with the foot placed on the slope of the bellows. Traditional construction was
used with cardboard stiffeners and oil-cloth cladding. The cladding was held down at the bottom by thin wooden
slats and at the top by a perspex cover, that enabled you to watch the leather valves flapping. 

<IMG SRC="bellowspump.jpg" ALT="Mo operating the hand-pumped bellows" ALIGN=RIGHT>
But not all organists can cope with that sort of pedelling, so a back up hand
operation seemed a good idea. So a simple lever pivotted at the organ centre enabled the up and down
motion pf the two bellows to be duplicated by hand or foot. This process removed the springs conventionally
used to bring the bellows up again after each depression. Of course the two bellows do not work independenly,
but this has been no problem in practice. The most tricky part was placing the oilcloth under the top perspex. 
It was necessary to have nuts and bolts coming through the perspex frame so that they could be tightened up at
the end. 
<P><B>The air reservoir</B><BR>
Especially with a bellows system it is important to have an air reservoir to stabilise the air pressure
while the bellows operates and while different numbers of keys are pressed. The reservoir was much easier to
make than the bellows, and was quite large, about 650 x 270 x 160 mm in size. The heavy wood frame provides the 
necessary constant pressure.
<IMG SRC="reservoirstructure.jpg" ALT="The air reservoir and it stabilising pantograph" ALIGN=RIGHT>
 

<P><B>The electric air pump</B><BR>
Mo was always keen on a non-electric human-powered organ, and that will be the second phase of 
construction. But for the construction and testing phase a pump was almost essential. I looked up the
professionals, Watkins and Watson were offering a reconditioned blower for £450, which seemed out of 
budget. 

<P>I tried quite hard to make one. From a skip outside Durham cathedral came a 50 watt variable speed fan.
I removed the actual fan blade and replaced it with a centrifugal blade made from wood. The rotor ran inside an old metal 
biscuit tin. 
It was quiet and blew the bass pipes rather well, but it was less than 1" water pressure and it did not
blow the bigger pipes. 

<P>Ebay did have one offer, a rather tiny low voltage pipe for about £30. I bought it, but it 
rather noisy and had to be encased in a wood and cotten felt to make it useable. It gave about 1.6" of water,
enough to blow all the pipes, as long as there were not too many at once! It was good for testing.
