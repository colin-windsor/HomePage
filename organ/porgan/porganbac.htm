<B>The rank of stopped diapason pipes</B><BR>
It started sadly, one of our organist friends from Upton sadly died suddenly. We sang
every week with his wife, and one day as she was clearing out her loft she said,
"Would we like to have a set of old organ pipes?" I was not at all certain, but when she brought
me one and I had a blow on it, I was inspired. It was an old wooden stopped diapason.
It started with a nice "chuff" and carried on with the soft woody sound of the very best
chamber organs.  You could tell its age from the nice cursive script that graced some of
the pipes. Sadly not all the pipes sounded so good, or indeed sounded at all. For no obvious
reason, some pipes just gave a woody hiss. It was possible that I may need some spares and
fortunately an advert in the <A HREF="http://www.eocs.co.uk">"Electronic Organ Constructers Society" </A>
magazine enabled me to buy a similar set. They proved most useful for spares although they 
generally did not sound so good.

<P>These pipes have the traditional organ range from C, two octaves below middle C,
to f''', two and a half octaves above middle C. The names and frequencies of the C's on the organ
are given in the table below, adapted from <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pitch_Table.png">Wikipedia </A>

<P><B>The physics of stopped diapason pipes</B><BR>
The speed of sound in air: <I>V=343.2</I> metres per second, is pretty fast, but musical frequencies are pretty high.
Middle C is <I>f=261.6 </I>cycles per second, for the standard tuning of <I>A=440</I>. Sound is a sinusoidal wave, 
and the wavelength for middle C is <span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span><I>=V/f=1312</I> mm.
<IMG SRC="PorganmiddleC.jpg" ALT="Our Middle C stopped pipe" ALIGN="LEFT">
The figure above shows how the pressure or amplitude of the sound wave changes with either time or space. It moves
along a <i>sine</I> wave which starts at a high positive amplitude, goes through zero to a negative amplitude,
and then back again to its starting amplitude. In a stopped pipe, the amplitude at the stopped end must be zero, while
the amplitude at the fipple end is large. The length of the stopped pipe is then just one quarter of a wavelength,
or about one foot for middle C. The figure on the left shows the middle C pipe from the set against a foot ruler.

Eindhoven, Netherlands" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<IMG SRC="porganfipple.jpg" ALT="The lowest C pipe with the fipple taken apart" ALIGN="LEFT">

Air blowing over the fipple creates turbulence with periodic pressure variations. The sound from these travels
down the pipe, is reflected from the stopped end, and returns to the fipple. It the length of the pipe is such that
the round trip time corresponds with the frequency, then the pipe <I>resonates</I> or sounds.
If the pipe is "open", then the pressure variation at its end will be high and the pipe will be twice as long
for the same resonant frequency. But open pipes tend to have more harmonics and give a less sweet tone that the
pure flute-like tones from the stopped pipes.
<P>The important fipple part of the pipe is shown taken apart for the lowest pipe on the organ <I>C</I>.
The air comes in through the tube on the right, rises up to a thin "airway", which tapers at the upper
end to produce a wide jet of air directed at the "labium" - the sharp edge of wood placed a centimetre
or so away from the end of the jet. The photo to the right shows the ffrqe
ent air stream which 
provides the stimulus for the resonant sound.

<P><B>The old Binns keyboard from Streatley Church</B><BR>
This was a work of art in itself. Our tuner said that Binn's organs were built like a battleship.
Although over 100 years old there were no signs of wear. The keys appear to be real ivory, 
and all the shafts of the keys are cut from a single piece of wood so that any relative distortion should
disappear. Their alignment is from one pin near their centre, with the red felt washer, and one pin 
under the key itself with the blue washer. They make
the sideways movement very small. As the figure shows they extend from 
two octaves below middle C (or CC in the old Helmholtz notation used by English organ 
builders) over four and one half octaves to the F two and a half octaves above middle C 
(or f'' in this notation). The keyboard frame was just 800 mm across and 740 mm deep and this
determined the size of the organ frame.

So often organs are wrapped up in beautiful cases. Until you open a door and have a look inside
the case you have no idea what is going on when you press a key. Peering round
inside the organ, you see all the pipes but they sit above a big windchest and that too
is tightly closed. The very place where the 
action that makes the pipe sound is placed is opaquely screwed up tight! 
I determined to make an organ without any case where all the pipes and all the action
would be visible. I would make a windchest with perspex sides so that you could see what 
was happening within its walls.

<P>By a lucky chance a good friend who lived near our French house in Belleme came round
one evening with a whole load of lengths of rectangular section oak. Actually they were
rejects from the wood-yard where they were making oak kitchen work surfaces by gluing these pieces
together. They were really for firewood, but there were enough good lengths there for me
to plan the whole frame of the organ. It turned out to be one of the easier jobs to 
cut the good pieces to length, and screw them together to make a rigid frame on which the
keyboard could rest. The rejects and end bits that I cut off did indeed end up on the fire!
The picture shows the nearly finished frame - it was later embellished with yet more struts.

<P>The large flat surfaces of 1" oak veneer used for the top, the base of the treadle board. and
the reservoir chest also have a history. They came from the wardrobe
doors of the three-piece suite I had as a 10-year old. They had had a 60-year use and it was touching
to use them again. 


<P><B>The action and windchest</B><BR>
The average spacing of the keys on a standard keyboard is around 13.5 mm. The widths across our pipes
are always larger than this - from 17 to 125 mm. The conventional solution for traditional organ construction is 
to make up a "roller board" that mechanically spreads out the action at the keys to the required spacing.
However if the keys are divided alternately into two sets, the average spacing of each set is
27 mm. This is sufficient wide for 19 mm outside diameter soft rubber pipe to be used as the spacing 
adjuster and that is the solution used here. The 16 largest pipes from C to d# are held vertically
along the back and left side. They would be blown by quite long rubber pipes connected to the
windchest. All the other pipes would simply hang upside down from rubber tubes
underneath the windchest.  

<P>The windchest is the central processor of a pipe organ. As each note key is pressed a stream of wind is sent 
to the appropriate pipe. Conventionally this is done by a soft leather-coated "palette" being moved
to let the air out through a hole beneath it. When there are several ranks of pipes, there will be a matrix
with "sliders" operated by the stops opening each rank. This organ has only the single rank of pipes
so that each palette opens a single hole. The figure to the left shows the palettes

 

<P><B>The electric air pump</B><BR>
Mo was always keen on a non-electric human-powered organ, and that will be the second phase of 
construction. But for the construction and testing phase a pump was almost essential. I looked up the
professionals, Watkins and Watson were offering a reconditioned blower for £450, which seemed out of 
budget. Ebay did have one offer, a tiny low voltage pipe for about £30. I bought it, but it
