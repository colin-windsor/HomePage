<P> Not much used on its own, this bright sound adds to the 8' Open Diaphason
and 4' Principal to give the main great sound played second.
<P>The second sounds are with the 4' Principal along with the 8' Open Diaphason .
<P>The third sounds are the 2' Fifteenth along with the soft 8' Dulciana. It gives a quiet 
bright sound suitable for faster pieces.
