<H1>Three Village Organs - one a <I>Prog</I> organ</H1>

Village organs in village churches are a precious part of our English life. 
My wife and I play typical village organs, she at St Mary&apos;s, Streatley in Oxfordshire 
and I (monthly) at nearby St John&apos;s, Whitchurch. Both are idyllic villages next to the 
river Thames with pristine cherished churches and loyal choirs.  
Their organs are of typical village size with 4 or so ranks on Great and Swell manuals, 
and a single Bourdon 16&apos; Pedal stop with couplers to Swell and Great. The organ at 
Streatley is a gorgeous 3-year-old <A HREF="www.jennings-organs.co.uk/"> Robin Jennings</A>
organ of classic style with 5 stops on Great and Swell. Whitchurch has a 1911 <A HREF=
"www.jwwalker.co.uk/"> Walker Organ </A> with just 4 stops on each side. Both organs have 
traditional &apos;tracker&apos; mechanical action with drawstops. Figure 1 shows the two organs, 
and my Prog organ. Their stop lists are shown in the table.

Figure 2 shows the keyboards of the three organs. All contain the classic Great organ stops: 
a soft 8&apos; Dulciana-like sound for quiet moments, an 8&apos; Open Diapason to accompany the hymns, 
and a 4&apos; Principal for the louder verses. Streatley has a 2&apos; Fifteenth for brightness 
and a Sesquialtera giving a trumpet-like sound. Whitchurch Hill has a sweet Wald flute 
just right for quieter accompaniments. The Swell organs are more different but all 
have distinctive sounds that contrast well with the Great sounds. 

<P> This summer I implemented <A HREF="www.pykett.org.uk/">Colin Pykett&apos;s</A> Prog organ 
into our existing console. This replaced Colin&apos;s earlier design based on MIDI keyboard presets. 
Our objective was to give us a practice organ as similar as possible to those we had to play. 
Listening to the sounds of Colin Pykett&apos;s “Small Digital Organ” (SDO) I selected the 
four Great and four Swell stops that I thought would best reproduce the sounds we were used to. 
The sounds of all the SDO stops can be heard on my 
<A HREF="freespace.virgin.net/colin.windsor/organ/eostops.htm">website</A>. 
We had room only for four drawstops on each side of the console if we were to maintain 
the big music stand which folds down on top of the keys. This turns the organ into our 
family computer, as described in our Magazine #199, October 2006. The stops I chose 
are shown in the last column of the table. For the Great the SDO gives us the classic 
choices of Dulciana, Diapason, Principal and Fifteenth. For the Swell the objective is 
to choose sounds contrasting with the Great.  The stopped Diapason and the Geigen Diapason 
and Principal give just this effect compared to the Great sounds. Mo and I did argue about 
the fourth Swell stop. She loved the fizzy Mixture III. I wanted the distinctive brassy 
Cornopean. I gave in as on my organ the drawstops are complemented by an array of 22 
push-button stops (from Maplin Electronics) situated beneath the great keyboard. 
These define SDO&apos;s additional Great and Swell stops, pedal stops, couplers and presets.

<P>
Figure 3 shows the Great drawstops of each organ. One of the most tricky skills in 
organ playing is to change stops seamlessly, without audible mechanical thuds, 
and without false sounds, from keeping your fingers so long on the keys that the 
new sound creeps in. You need to practice this just as you need to practice playing the keys. 
So my Prog drawstops are designed to work and feel like those of the tracker organs. 
The Hall effect drawstops 
were made with the kind advice of Ron Coates of <A HREF="www.classicorgans.co.uk/">
Classic Organs</A> and our Treasurer. The Hall effect uses the bending of moving 
electrons under a magnetic field to produce a voltage. The sensor looks like a 
tiny transistor, and the magnet is hardly bigger. Sensor and magnet cost a few pounds 
only. More details are given in another page of my 
<A HREF="freespace.virgin.net/colin.windsor/organ/halleffect.htm">website</A>.  
Setting them up is a bit tricky because the placing of the magnet near the 
sensor needs to be within a few millimetres.  But they seem very robust and 
once adjusted have given no trouble.  The drawstops themselves were made of 
square section wood and held in place by a square wooden lattice at front 
and back as shown in figure 3. The lattice was easily made from a gorgeous 
piece of teak panelling which happened to be in my workshop. 
The apertures are lined with thin leathers to give just the right friction 
to the drawstop. Once adjusted, the drawstops are very easy and quick to operate. 
<P> 
I have been delighted with the results! Combinations of the eight drawstops 
alone give a truly enormous variety of sounds and are appropriate for essentially 
all the music I play. Moving registration ideas from Prog organ to Streatley and 
to Whitchurch organs has proved an easy task.
<P>
If village organs tend to  stay the same, village organists are changing. 
I remember when we came to the area 35 years ago hearing dazzling voluntaries 
in our local churches. Most organists were highly experienced. Now it is different. 
The organists I had listenened to have retired. They have been replaced, well by 
people like me – pianists without a single organ lesson, who have taught themselves 
by their ears, and in my case from an ancient copy of Stainer&apos;s excellent 1909 
Novello&apos;s primer “The Organ”.  Some organists have not been replaced. 
Some, as at Whitchuch, have been replaced by a monthly rota. There are 16 organist 
vacancies on the Berkshire Organists&apos; Association website. We must work to keep the 
sounds of our village organs alive. Prog organ is important, as without it to 
practice on, I should never have dared play in church.
