<p><b>Abstract:</B>
Neutron diffraction measurements of the lattice strains in a sample of annealed molybdenum 
show evidence of a sharp redistribution of the strains at the elastic limit. 
The use of a highly textured sample enabled the effects of crystalline anisotropy within 
grains to be precisely defined in a way impossible with a isotropic polycrystalline sample. 
The measurements are  explained by a theory in which a collective yield of the most highly 
strained crystallites may occur depending on the shape of the distribution of yield strains 
as a function of the crystallite orientation.

<p><B>1. Introduction and the experimental results</B>
<p>The elastic behaviour of the aggregates of anisotropic crystallites that make up a 
polycrystalline sample is well understood. However the present measurements reveal the 
onset of plasticity to be a complicated process depending on the detailed orientation 
of the grains with respect to the applied stress, which in the cases of annealed molybdenum 
show elements of a first order phase transition. High resolution neutron diffraction provides 
a way of measuring the strains within a bulk specimen under an applied stress as a function 
of the orientation of the crystallites[1]. Each crystallite acts as an atomic strain gauge 
enabling the lattice strain to be measured directly, independently of the macroscopic strain.

<I>Figure 1. The sample in place on a neutron diffractometer under an applied stress
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span> . 
The sample could be orientated such that strains both parallel (i) and perpendicular (ii) 
to the applied stress could be measured.</i>

<p>Figure 1 shows the layout of the rig used to apply a defined constant stress onto a sample 
on the neutron diffractometer. The samples took the form of a machined cylinder 3mm in 
diameter and 50mm long so that the centre of the sample bathed in the neutron beam 
was subject to a nearly uniform stress. The rig could be oriented on the diffractometer 
so that, at any one stress level, the strains both parallel (i) and perpendicular (ii) to the 
stress could be measured for several different Bragg reflections reflecting the response of 
differing crystallite orientations.

<p>The sample was pure molybdenum drawn through a die to produce a strong texture such 
that all crystallites contained 110 planes nearly perpendicular to the sample axis. 
Molybdenum has the body-centred cubic (bcc) structure. Thus with the sample in the 
parallel configuration of Figure 1(i) the [220] Bragg reflection was observed strongly with 
14000 cts/min, while other allowed Bragg reflections were much weaker: 
[211]: 120 cts/min, [400]:  68 cts/min, [222]: 28 cts/min. However there was no measurable 
preferred orientation within this plane so that Bragg planes perpendicular to the [110] direction 
could be observed at all orientations.

<I>Figure 2. The [1-10] section of the Molybdenum body centered cubic reciprocal lattice showing 
the observed planes perpendicular to the to [110] axis.</i>

<p>perpendicular to the sample axis with their expected intensities. Such planes have Miller 
indices <I>[hkl]</I> where <I>h.1+k.1+k.0=0</I> so that <I>h=-k</I> and <I>l</I> may have 
any value. 
Figure 2 illustrates the four directions <I>[004], [1-12], [2-22]</I> and <I>[2-20]</I>, 
all of which are 
perpendicular to the <I>[110]</I> direction and were observed in this experiment. 
The crystallite orientation can in this case be defined by the angle 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> as in the figure. 

<p>The elastic properties of a cubic material such as molybdenum are well understood [2]. 
They may be defined by the three elastic compliances constants <I>S<sub>11</sub>, S <sub>12</sub>
</i> and  <I>S<sub>44</sub></i>. 
The general expression for the strain <span style='font-family:Symbol'>e</span>
 for a given applied stress <span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span>, defining the 
compliance <I>S</I>, can be defined in terms of the direction cosines of the reflecting plane [hkl], 
the direction cosines of the applied stress uvw, and the angle 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>W</span> between the two as
<P><I>S = <span style='font-family:Symbol'>e</span>/<span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span>  
= S<SUB>11</SUB>cos<SUP>2</SUP>(<span style='font-family:Symbol'>W</span>) + 
S<SUB>12</SUB>sin<SUP>2</SUP>(
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>W</span>
) – 2S'(hkuv + klvw + klwu)</i>...(1)
<P>where
<P><I>   	S' = S<sub>11</sub>- S<sub>12</sub> - S<sub>44</sub>/2</i>...(2)
<P>Therefore in the case of Figure 1(i) where the strain is measured parallel to the direction
of stress, <span style='font-family:Symbol'>W</span> = 0º, 
<i>[hkl] = [2<SUP>-½</SUP>,2<SUP>-½</SUP>,0]</i>, and
<p><i>S<sup> para</sup> = S<sub>11</sub>- S'/2</i>...(3)
<p>In the perpendicular case of Figure 1(ii), <span style='font-family:Symbol'>W</span>
 = 90º, <i>[uvw]</i> is unchanged, and <i>[hkl]</i>  may be defined in terms of the angle 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> between the direction <i>[hkl</i>] and the <i>[100]</i> 
direction as <i>[sin <span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span>/2<SUP>-½</SUP>,sin 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> /2<SUP>-½</SUP>,cos<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f
</span> )</i> 

<p>to give 
<p><i>S<sup> perp</sup>(<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> 
) = S<sub>12</sub>+ S'(sin2<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> 
)/2  = S<sub>B</sub>+ S<sub>A</sub>(cos2<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span>)</i>...(4)
<p>where  
<p><i>S<sub>B</sub>= S<sub>12</sub> + S'/4,</i>  and  <i>S<sub>A</sub>=  S'/4</i>...(5)
<p>The experiments were performed on the D1A diffractometer at the Institute Laue Langevin at
Grenoble [3]. Some of the experimental results are shown in Figure 3. 
In the case of the first specimen  M65, the sample was first loaded up to a stress of 300MPa 
where the sample began to show plasticity. This could be easily identified on our rig as a 
tendency of the sample to increase its strain at a constant stress. The applied stress was 
then reduced to zero in 5 steps, and then increased again to 300Mpa. A further 6 increased 
levels of stress were then applied up to 360Mpa when the sample stress could no longer 
be maintained without a continuous increase in strain. The stress removal was largely 
reversible as shown by the two nearly identical values on the graph for 300Mpa. Only strains 
measured with increasing stress are shown in the figure.

<I>Figure 3. The measured strains for the Molybdenum sample M65 for the [220] pararallel 
reflection and the [400], [211], [222] and [220] directions in the perpendicular direction.</i>

<p>In the parallel configuration, only the <i>[220]<sup> para</SUP></i> reflection was measured. 
It showed elastic behaviour up to 220Mpa, and then showed a small increase in strain as 
it entered the plastic region corresponding to the small increase in its compliance. 
In the perpendicular configuration, the four reflections measured each showed quite 
different behaviour. Here the Poisson's ratio effect means that a positive stress gives 
rise to a negative strain. The <i>[400]</i> perpendicular reflection is anomalous. It begins to 
show breakdown of elastic behaviour at 200MPa and by 240MPa all the lattice strain has 
been lost. Further stress applied in the plastic regime gives no positive strain, and 
indeed if anything causes a slight positive strain. In contrast the <i>[220]</i> and 
<i>[222]</i> perpendicular
reflections both show an appreciable increase in strain when they entered the plastic 
region. The <i>[211]</i> perpendicular reflection showed essentially no discontinuous change 
on entering the plastic region. The results were repeated with a second specimen M68 
with very similar results.

<P>The calculated elastic compliances have been evaluated using equations 4 and 5, and are 
seen to account well for the observed values. The almost elastic behaviour seen in the parallel direction is 
expected for this sample since all crystallites have a similar compliance in this direction 
of stress. Figure 4 shows the expected linear relationship when the perpendicular compliances 
are plotted against <i>sin<sup>2</sup><span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span>/2</i>. 



<p>Within the plastic region, a new compliance constant may be estimated. By extrapolating the 
linear compliance constants in the two regions a yield ratio <i>R</i> may be defined for each 
reflection to indicate the fraction by which the strain increases or decreases as the sample 
enters the plastic regime. These constants are shown in Table 3 and by the open circles in 
figure 4.

<I>Figure 5. It is assumed that the sample consists of N crystallites subjected 
to an average stress <span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span>=F/N. The crystallites are 
textured so that all lie within a plane perpendicular to the [110] direction.</I>

<p><B>3. A model for anisotropic plastic relazation in a textured sample </B>
<p>FIgure 5 illustrates a model for the stability of the aggregate of crystalline grains 
within the sample. The sample is assumed to consist of <i>N</i> crystalline grains, 
and to carry a total force <i>F</i>. Assuming that all grains are roughly equal in area, 
each will carry a parallel stress  <i><span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span>=F/N</i>.  
We also assume that, as is the case for our specimen to a close approximation, 
the crystallites have a common <i>[110]</i> axis along the direction of the stress but are 
randomly distributed in the plane perpendicular to this direction. Under these 
approximations the perpendicular compliance in the grains will vary as defined in equation 3.  

<p>The strain within each crystallite will depend on the angle 
<i><span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span></i> within the plane perpendicular to the <i>[110]</i> 
direction depending on  the compliance variation <i>S <sup>perp</sup>
(<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span>) = S<sub>B</sub>+ S<sub>A</sub>
(cos2<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span>)</i>
given previously in equation 4.

<p>The density of crystallites in the perpendicular orientation <i>

probability density (equation 6) against the angle <span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> 
within the plane perpendicular to the <i>[110]</i> direction. It is seen that the compliance 
level follows a sinusoidal curve with the smallest negative stress along the [004] 
reflection direction and the largest along the <i>[110]</i> direction, as was observed
experimentally and reported in table 2. The distribution of crystallites with a 
given compliance follows equation 6 above with divergences at the values 
<i>S = S<SUB>B</SUB> ± S<SUB>A</SUB></I>.

<p>As the load on the sample is increased, the perpendicular stress on each crystallite 
increases at differing rates according to the compliance at the angle 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span>. The crystallite with the highest stress, 
and so the first to yield, will be those along the <i>[110]</i> direction where the compliance
is greatest. If a crystallite yields, it will be assumed that it carries no further 
stress and that its strain is distributed among the remaining <i>N -1</i> crystallites.
