<H1>A Bass Recorder between Round and Square?
<H2><I>Colin Windsor</I>
<p>Last Christmas, my
first choice for a present was a bass recorder, but a nice wooden one seemed
way outside our budget. The second choice was an electric router. These are
like fast power drills with a special bit that can cut sideways as well as
down. It set my mind working! With a bit of jigging and poking it is possible
to cut a half inch rectangular grove as long as a bass recorder, as deep as its
bore, and even at an angle to the surface of the wood! I spent some
mathematical hours exploring the options for the bore cross-section shown in
figure 1. All the shapes shown have exactly the same cross-sectional area.

The easiest shape to
make with a router would be the square section shown dashed in the figure. But
with a semi-circular "radius" router bit (beyond my budget) or a
round-bladed chisel, is quite easy to make a semi-circular round bottom to the
solid square section as shown by the long-dashed line. But why stop there? The
router can easily cut a slot at some defined angle <i><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=6>f  
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5></I> to the
vertical so that the circular part of the cross-section is extended even further.
This design has the further advantage that the side walls can be thicker at the
top where the lid is screwed on. I chose the angle of <i><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=6>
 f<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5>= 20 degrees</i> for the side wall
upper angle shown by the heavy line in the figure. It gives a nice compromise
between extending the circle, and providing a big enough opening for your
chisel. Making the bore in a single unjointed piece takes out the work and weight
of the joints. Its not practical to clean the bore after every session, but if
its "lid" is screwed on and sealed rather than glued, it can be
removed every so often for a spring-clean. The direct blowing position is fine
for me. I made a Mark II with the fipple on the lower surface, which makes it
easier for the hands to reach the keys.</p>

<p>Lying in my garage was a lovely slab of ash,
originally given to me for wood carving but still awaiting inspiration. It was
75 mm thick and looked long enough for a bass recorder. I played the three
wooden bass recorders in our little group that meets at Wantage on Wednesday
nights. I borrowed them, (thank you Kathleen, Mary and Maggy) and measured
everything I could. They were surprisingly different, and different too from
the "official" Dolmetsch inter-key-hole distances you can read on
their website (www.dolmetsch.com). The bores were all approximately conical,
with the ratio of the head bore to the end bore being about 1.5. I chose
Kathleen's as it was the shorter - fipple to tip was 863 mm - nearly exactly
the length of my slab of wood, and sounded good all over its register.</p>

The first job,
recorded for posterity in figure 2, was to cut out a tapering slab to define
the width of the outside of the recorder I used a simple hand saw as it could
make a thin and accurate cut. A band saw would be better. The second cut made
the 5 mm thick lid over the same area. The last long cut defined the depth, not
counting the lid, and also tapered. There remained plenty of wood of the
correct width for the mouthpiece and the keys.</p>

workbench. The recorder blank is screwed to a piece of old plywood, which is in
turn bolted through the wedge to the bench to tilt the blank so that the
vertical router bit cuts the slanted edge.</p>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5>


<p>I ended with a solid
recorder blank 863 mm long, 50 mm wide by 45 mm deep at the fipple end and 37 x
32 at the tip end. I used a 1400 mm long piece of old plywood as the support
for the blank, screwing through the plywood into the edges of the recorder
blank which would later be planed off. I planed the top surface of the blank
where the lid would sit, and used a sharp spike to draw on to the two ends of
the blank the shape drawn thick in figure 1, scaled to the radius 19 mm at the
fipple end and 12.5 mm radius at the tip end.</p>

<p>I used the router by making it traverse an
unchanging straight path, and using wedge-shaped pieces of waste wood to hold
the work piece at the right position and angle so that the cutter took the
required path. My father's old bench had a tool recess beneath its working
surface, and I used the outside of this to provide the defining straight edge,
which the router edge guide would slide along as shown in figure 4. Simple 20 
degree wedges provided the necessary angles and a
threaded rod through an oval hole provided the lateral adjustment. I used a
mirror to peer down the two ends of the recorder blank to adjust the cutter to
line up on my pencil marks at each end. Of course this point is best approached
in slow steps roughing out the wood some way from the pencil line first. Having
completed the two sloping sides to the bore, and roughed out its base as shown
on figure 3, the semi-circular cross section was quickly finished off with a
7mm rounded blade chisel. Plenty of sandpaper was used to finish off the bore.
</p>

<p>The "lid" was then planed down on both sides to its final thickness of 3 mm and
sandpapered smooth so that is made a good fit with the bore. I then screwed it
onto the bore with countersunk brass screws.</p>

<p>Screwed together, the recorder bore and lid
are much more robust and the outside of the bore can be planed off. I made a
6-sided shape giving a flat bottom which sits nicely on the thumb later.
Deciding how much to plane off is a compromise between strength and weight. I
left a wall-thickness as little as 3 mm on the sides. This gave a total
recorder weight of only 460 grams!</p>

<p> Now is a good time to
sharpen your best 25mm flat chisel, have a cup of tea so that you are fresh and
relaxed, and prepare to cut the fipple from your planed lid. There is room for
an edge 25 mm wide. I defined the angled edges with two sawcuts, cut out the
wedge with the chisel, and severed the sharp end with a blow on my chisel. It
took only 10 minutes.</p>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5>

<p>The wind pipe
aperture needs to be about 1 mm deep and 25 mm across to match the fipple, and
at least 15 mm long. I made it from two flat pieces screwed together. The lower
piece contained the entire 1 mm grove so that when you peered through the blowing
aperture you could see the fipple edge nicely framed near the top of the
aperture. A third flat piece covered the fipple end of the recorder. The
windpipe can be widened out to blow directly as in the figure, or you can 
make the fipple on the lower surface.</p>

<p>Do not blow into your completed mouthpiece and
bore just yet! It will depress you. The next job is to buy some kitchen sealant, 
undo all the screws, and place sealant along all the surfaces that should be airtight. 
PVA wood glue would do the job, but the sealant allows the pieces to be
prized apart for the inevitable adjustments. My recorder then sounded a most
melliferous low F! The holes can now all be drilled. It is worth investing in a
proper wood drill with a central spike and giving a clean edge. The placing of
the holes on a flat lid is a bit of a problem. I used the width of the lid to
help the holes fit my fingers. I made the keys out of 3 mm thick flat wood from
the left-over timber. The tiny hinges and screws were difficult to buy in DIY
stores but easy in a little old-fashioned ironmonger in Burnham on Sea! I found
three quality coil springs in an old gramophone turntable. The pads need to be
adjusted so that they sit exactly parallel to the hole apertures beneath them.
For the pad surface, some fine leather proved less good than an old bicycle
inner tube, which in turn was less good than some softer plastic rubbery foam
material. I cannot say that the end result is as good as that of the best round
bass recorders, but in playing you soon get used to the positioning of the fingers. 
The playing position in figure 5 
shows the fingers on the corners of the two central keys, where they give the
most leaverage. The bottom F key needed an extension piece for my little finger
beneath the surface of the lid.</p>

<p>Tuning is patience! A
piece of sandpaper wrapped round a pencil will widen the holes gently. I
started at the bottom of the register and moved upwards using my ear and an
electronic organ. £20 will buy an electronic tuner. I varnished and sandpapered
the wood both inside and outside, several times!

<p>After all the thinking and drawing, the construction job took only a few working days.
It seemed much easier than making its wooden case.</p>



<H1>Appendix:
The mathematics between round and square</H1></p>

Exploring figure 1 in more detail, a circular cross-section of radius <i>r</i> 
has the area <i>A = <FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=6>p  
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5>r<sup>2</sup></I>. 
A square cross-section with the same area (dashed) has a side-length 
<i>w = (<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=6>p  
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5>/2)<sup>1/2</sup>r</I>. 

A semi-circular round base of radius <i>r</i> with a rectangular top section <i>2r</i>
wide, (dot-dashed) needs to have a height
<i>h = (<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=6>p  
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5>/4)r</I>. 
If the circle is extended on each side until it
makes an angle <i><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=6>f  
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5></I>  with the horizontal, 
<i>rsin<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=6>f<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5></I> 
above the circle centre, the upper side walls
make an angle <i><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=6>f  
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5></I> 
with the vertical, and extend for a vertical
