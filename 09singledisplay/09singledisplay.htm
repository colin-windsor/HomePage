</FONT><I><P><B>Abstract- </I>The RASCAN holographic radar system has been developed by the 
Remote Sensing Laboratory of Bauman Moscow Technical University. The present design uses five 
frequencies and two polarisations to give 10 distinct images of scan from buried objects. 
Because of the sinusoidal phase variation of the interference signals, all displays show a 
complex picture of dark and light phases which vary in a complicated way between different 
frequencies and polarizations. This is a preliminary investigation into the optimal 
presentation of the 10 images as a single composite image. The objective is to display as 
much as possible of the information present in the original image.  The solution presented 
here is to sum the absolute values of the background-corrected amplitude over both the five 
frequencies and the two polarizations. The method is justified using an experiment in which 
nine US pennies, and 9 metal washers, were buried in sand at increasing depths in the range 
0 to 56 mm. The method is illustrated by example images from the fields of civil engineering 
and mine detection.</B><P>&nbsp;</P></B>

<P>Conventional Ground Penetrating Radar uses echo sounding from a pulsed source 
to determine the range of buried objects [1]. A quite different radar system was developed 
by the Remote Sensing Laboratory of Bauman Moscow Technical University [2]. Their RASCAN 
system uses continuous wave unmodulated signals at several different frequencies. 
The signal reflected from the subsurface structure is multiplied by the original signal 
from the antenna to form a hologram. The amplitude and phase of the hologram is sensitive 
to the depth of any buried object, to its reflectivity and to the properties of the medium. 
The indication of depth is indicated by the phase change of the radar wave in passing 
through the material to the buried object. The indication of reflectivity is given by the 
amplitude of the reflected signal.  Generally the antenna and receiver are the same, and 
placed close to the ground surface. The holographic amplitude and phase may be presented 
as a function of position (x, y) across the ground surface and scanned manually or 
automatically to give a holographic image H(x,y) whose amplitude may be plotted as a 
grey scale image. In the RASCAN system five frequencies are operated simultaneously to give 
five different holographic images whose amplitude and phase response differs as the phase 
change caused by the phase difference along the path length alters. The RASCAN system also 
has two perpendicular polarizations so that the response may be measured both along and 
perpendicular to the scanning direction.

is being swept along the scan direction. The progress of the scan could be watched on 
the monitor behind.</P></B>

The RASCAN system thus results in 10 different 
holographic response images. The RASCAN display software allows all 10 images to be 
displayed either simultaneously, or as a time-sequence set of images. Neither is 
completely satisfactory for use by unskilled operators and the present paper considers 
ways in which the 10 individual holograms may be combined into a single composite image. </P>


<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>2. The conventional display from a typical RASCAN image</P></B></FONT>

<P>As an example image, a floor scan of a concrete floor containing conduits, metal 
meshes and metal pan decking has been chosen. The scan was made at the Fackenthal Hall at 
Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, USA. Figure 1 shows the floor in question, with 
the RASCAN being manually pushed along the scan direction (x). The scan length was 500 mm 
with measurements every 5 mm. The scans were repeated at 20 mm intervals along the direction 
perpendicular to the scan (y), over 2m. This gave 100x100 points in total although the images 
displayed here will only extend over only 60x60 points as much of the scan is a repetitive 
background.  Figure 2 shows the display given by the RASCAN software.

<P><B>Figure 2. The display from the RASCAN software. The five frequencies  
from 3.6 to 4.0 Ghz are displayed from left to right and the two polarisations are parallel 
above and cross polarised below.</B></P>

<P>Several sets of features are visible in these images. The thin vertical bands sometimes light, 
sometimes dark, are likely to be the vertical rebars. The broader bands seen at other frequencies 
are likely to be the corrugations of the pan decking. The thin horizontal bands, more clearly 
seen on the cross polarization are likely to be the horizontal rebars. At the lower right is 
clearly seen a diagonal electrical conduit that appears either light or dark in many of the 
images. This series of images is clearly not straightforward to understand without careful 
study of all the images. Can this process be simplified without loss of detail?

The image is sum of the differences from the background level summed over all the ten images 
shown above. All the featues mentioned above may be seen.</B></FONT>

<P>The RASCAN software package has one such process. An option is to display the images 
within each polarisation direction in sequence. It helps greatly in the process of assimilating 
the data together.


<P>An example of our approach is shown in figure 3. The method has many options and this is 
just one result. The method will be explored in more detail using images from a much simpler 
example: a series of buried pennies of different depths.  


<FONT SIZE=><P><B>3.The method explored for a simple RASCAN image</P></B></FONT>

<P>Figure 4 above, shows raw RASCAN data from a scan over 9 US pennies buried in sand at 
increasing depths from about zero on the left to about 65 mm on the right. Only the 
parallel polarisation is shown. The scan length and separation were both 1 cm. These 
experiments are presented in more detail in reference [4] from this meeting. The lower 
set of circles were some other foreign coins, and are not analysed here.

<IMG ALIGN="CENTRE" SRC="sdfig4b.jpg">

<P>The scans were 
made along the direction of increasing depth by manually moving the RASCAN head on a glass 
plate over the sand surface.
An interesting feature is that the background level at each frequency is quite different. 
In holographic radar there is no specific “main bang” ground reflection from the surface. 
In this case it is an air-sand interface covered by a thin plastic sheet. Rather the amplitude 
and phase of the reflected wave from the surface interferes with the incident wave to give 
a characteristic background signal level. In this example, there was a wide region of sand 
without pennies that could be analysed to give the background level. 

<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="sdfig5.jpg">
<P><B>Figure 5. The histogram of signal amplitudes over the raw data from a scan over 9 
US pennies buried in sand. The scan showed a larger region of background than is shown in 
figure 3. Note the change in amplitude with frequency.</B></P> 

<P>Figure 5 shows the 
histogram of the amplitudes for each of the frequencies. There is width to the peak in 
amplitude at each frequency and a small almost invisible “tail” to the distribution from 
the much larger amplitude variations present in the portion of the scan representing the 
pennies. This background level is important in since it enables “contrast”, or deviation 
from background, to be identified. Positive and negative phases have at last a clear meaning. 
In the pennies scan that particular scan giving the largest amplitude across each penny 
was identified, (almost always one particular scan) and the coloured lines in figure 6 
shows this scan for each of the five frequencies. It is seen that for penny 1 all the 
frequencies show a positive peak. For penny 2 the 3.7 GHz peak has the largest positive 
amplitude and the 3.9 GHz the largest negative peak. For penny 4 the 4.0 GHz peak has the 
largest positive amplitude and the 3.6 GHz the largest negative amplitude. 
By penny 6 this situation is almost reversed.

Figure 7 shows this representation for the pennies scan. The first seven pennies are 
clearly delineated with positive signals and there are suggestions of the remaining two deeper pennies.

<P>Returning to the Fackenthal Hall location a second image was taken of an interesting location 
which showed two holes 16 cm diameter separated by 36 cm. The scans are again parallel to the 
corrugations. A portion of the RASCAN data collected are shown in figure 8 with the same 
presentation as with the scan of figure 2. Much is seen in this image: in particular the 
two holes appear with varying phases. Some scans show clear vertical lines which are 
probably from electrical conduit which approach the holes in both directions.

<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="sdfig8.jpg">

two holes and several unknown signals. On the left is shown the scene and below is shown 
the composite image from parallel perpendicular and combined polarisations.</B></P>

<P>In the lower part of figure 8 the two polarisations, parallel and perpendicular to the 
scan direction (left to right) are shown separately. In this case they are appreciably 
different with the corrugations being much clearer in the parallel direction.


<P>A third example is RASCAN image of simulated mines and is from the published literature [3].  
In figure 9 above is shown on the left the four simulated mines. Two of the simulants were 
made of metal and they are easily picked up by the metal detector scan shown in the centre 
of the figure. On the right is shown the amplitude composite image. This is presented on a 
logarithmic scale and shows some noise background. However the two metal mines are also 
seen very clearly, as is a length of metal wire which was placed beneath the sand surface. 
The two plastic simulants are seen on the lower left and right. The rather conspicuous 
object in the lower centre of the figure is a “knee print” from one of the operators.

<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>5. Conclusions</P></B></FONT>

<P>A method for combining the ten images given by the RASCAN system is proposed based on a 
sum of the modulus of the background-corrected amplitudes, without affecting the spatial 
resolution. 

<P>In the pennies experiment the summed images showed all pennies distinctly. 
In the Fackenthal Hall experiment the summed images showed all the expected features, 
including the conduit, the metal mesh and the deeper metal pan decking. 

<P>In the test bed of the University of Florence experiment with simulated mines, 
all four mines, two metal and two plastic were all seen satisfactorily.

<P>The precise form of the average over background corrected amplitudes does not seem critical.
