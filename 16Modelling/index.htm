<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>
<p>Numerical studies have been made to improve the performance of the central column of a superconducting spherical 
tokamak fusion pilot plant. The assumed neutron shield includes concentric layers of tungsten carbide and water. 
The relative thickness of the water layers was varied and a minimum power deposition was found at about 17% of water. 
It was found advantageous to have an approximately 1.7 times thicker water layer next to the core and a similarly thinner 
layer next to the plasma. The use of tungsten boride instead of tungsten carbide was shown to make an improvement 
especially if placed close to the central superconducting core, the inner layer alone reducing the power deposition by 29%. 
Engineering features such as a central steel tie-bar, an insulating thermal vacuum gap, a wall gap next to the plasma 
and knowledge of the vertical energy distribution are essential to a successful design and their effects on the power 
deposition are shown in an appendix. The results have been fitted to model distributions and incorporated into the 
Tokamak Energy System Code, which can then give predictions of the power deposition as a function of other 
parameters such as the plasma major radius and the maximum magnetic field permitted on the superconductors.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>Calculations now suggest that by using the high plasma pressures possible with spherical tokamaks and the high 
magnetic fields possible with high temperature superconducting (HTS) coils, it may be possible to construct a relatively 
compact fusion power plant [1,2].  A key problem for this approach has been the power deposition from fusion neutrons 
into a superconducting central column. The spherical tokamak approach implies a slender central core containing the 
superconducting coils. However the effects of both radiation damage and power deposition into the core demand an 
effective neutron and gamma shield. 

<P>The outer edge of the shield receives mostly 14 MeV fusion neutrons. The shield aims to reduce the power deposited 
in the core both by attenuation of the particle fluxes and by lowering particle energies, since absorption cross sections 
generally increase with decreasing energy. High-energy neutrons are best attenuated by heavy metals since they typically 
have larger cross-sections, around 10 barns, above MeV energies. Tungsten is particularly useful because of its
 absorptive "giant resonances" in the energy range 10 eV to 10 keV. Gamma ray production from 
(n,&gamma;) reactions is 
significant, giving rise to appreciable fluxes of gamma rays with energies around 1 MeV. 

<P>In all cases the power deposition arising from both neutrons and gamma rays must be computed, as their contributions 
are comparable. Water or some other coolant will be necessary to remove the heat deposited, but at MeV energies water 
has quite low cross sections for both scattering and attenuation with mean free paths more than 0.1 m. Nearer to the core 
energies are lower and the water moderation becomes more effective. At this stage, elements with large absorption cross 
sections, such as boron, can remove neutrons.  Increasing the shield thickness is always an option but if the shield is too 
thick the performance advantages of the spherical tokamak are reduced.  Careful optimisation is necessary to achieve 
the best compromise between radiation damage, cryogenic cooling requirements and tokamak performance. Using 
Monte Carlo simulations computed with MCNP Version 6.1 [3] of the power deposition similar to those reported in [1]
 several new results are obtained. The water layer thickness has been varied to reveal an optimum thickness. The water
 layer's spacing with increasing radius in the shield has been varied again showing an optimum having a thicker water 
spacing close to the core where moderation is most needed. Shield materials have been varied: differing numbers of 
radial layers of tungsten boride have been inserted into a tungsten carbide shield and shown to give appreciably lower 
power deposition in the superconducting core, especially for the layer next to the core. 

<P>In an appendix, the effects of engineering features such as a central tie-bar, a thermal vacuum gap to insulate the 
central core, and a plasma-wall gap have been included. The shield thickness variation is extended to low thickness, 
and the vertical distribution of the heat deposition along the length of the core has been evaluated and shown to follow 
a roughly Gaussian distribution. 

<P>The results for these and other extensions are presented here, and fitted to simple analytic functions, which have 
been incorporated into the Tokamak Energy System Code described in [2]. It then becomes straightforward to 
investigate the importance of each physics and engineering parameter and to provide a method for optimisation 
of the design.

<p>In the earlier paper [1] a step-wise approach was proposed starting with the simplest realistic model of a power plant,

stresses induced in the core, a thermal vacuum gap of thickness <I>d<SUB>vac</SUB></I> to insulate the cold superconducting core (say at 20 K) 
from the warm neutron shield, and a plasma-facing wall gap of thickness <I>d<SUB>gap</SUB></I> on the outside of the shield, which may 
contain a vacuum vessel, and plasma-facing tiles. These additions are illustrated in figure 1.

<P>An objective of this work was to enhance the utility of the Tokamak Energy System Code, described in [2] together 
with its supplementary material. This reference suggested that further engineering details were planned to be 
incorporated into the code and this has been done in the present work. The System Code has both input and 
output variables and table 1 shows a selection of these variables defining the reference pilot plant design used 
in the present paper. The numbers differ slightly from those in reference [2] because of subsequent refinements to the code.

<P>was shown in [1] that the logarithm of the power deposition <I>P<SUB>tot</SUB></I> was linear in the three principal parameters
 (<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>, <I>r<SUB>sc</SUB></I>, <I>d<SUB>shield</SUB></I>) to around 5% accuracy over wide ranges and this result remains the starting point for the present work. 
The power deposition into the cryogenic central superconducting core can then be represented in the System Code 
by a single spreadsheet entry or MATLAB equation

<P>Where <I>P<SUB>tot</SUB></I> is the total deposited power in MW and <I>P<SUB>neut</SUB></I> is the tokamak 
neutron power in MW.  0.05286 is the power deposition in MW in the reference design and the next three terms are 
the coefficients from [1] of the logarithm of the power deposition with respect to major radius <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>, 
superconducting core radius <I>r<SUB>sc</SUB></I>, and shield 
thickness <I>d<SUB>shield</SUB></I> as deviations from their values in the reference design of table 1. 
This equation will be extended 
through this paper.

<P>The details of the engineering extensions to the code are given in the Appendix. Their effects on the deposited 
power are summarised in figure 2 for changes in parameters around the reference design with major radius <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=1.35 m, 
superconducting core radius <I>r<SUB>sc</SUB></I> =0.20 m, which includes a tie-bar radius <I>r<SUB>tie</SUB></I> =0.05 m, so that the superconductor 
thickness is dsc =0.15 m. Also included is a thermal vacuum gap <I>d<SUB>vac</SUB></I>=0.03 m, 
and a plasma-wall gap thickness <I>d<SUB>gap</SUB></I> =0.05 m. These figures lead to a power deposition <I>P<SUB>tot</SUB></I> = 0.053 MW. 
Using the System Code it is possible to evaluate how the power deposition changes as each of the variables 
is changed individually. 

<P><IMG SRC="Fig2.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B>Figure 2.</B> 
The calculated deposited power into a central superconducting core of a simplified plant as a function of 
superconducting core radius <I>r<SUB>sc</SUB></I>, vacuum gap thickness <I>d<SUB>vac</SUB></I>, wall gap thickness <I>d<SUB>gap</SUB></I> ,
 major radius <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> 
and tie-bar radius <I>r<SUB>tie</SUB></I> All the results are presented against a single distance increment whose starting point 
corresponds to the reference design with a central column radius <I>R<SUB>c</SUB></I>=0.55 m,  
tie-bar radius <I>r<SUB>tie</SUB></I> =0.05 m, the superconducting core radius <I>r<SUB>sc</SUB></I>,=0.2 m, the vacuum gap <I>d<SUB>vac</SUB></I>, =0.03 m, 
shield thickness Tshield=0.32 m,  plasma wall gap <I>d<SUB>gap</SUB></I>=0.05 m, and major radius <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> =1.35 m. 
When changing the wall gap and major radius the central column radius changes along with the fusion energy. 
In all cases the shield thickness is changed to keep the major radius constant, the central temperature 
adjusted to reach 0.8 of the Greenwald density limit and the toroidal field adjusted to reach 0.9 of the Troyon beta limit.  
</FONT>

<P>Figure 2 shows the power deposition on a log scale and it is clear that over this limited distance scale, all the variations, 
except that due to the tie-bar radius, follow linear plots with distance on this logarithmic scale. 
The gradients of the variables listed in decreasing absolute order are shown in the figure caption. 
The tie-bar gradient is only appropriate near the value <I>r<SUB>tie</SUB></I>=0.05 m.

<P>It is seen that the superconducting core radius causes an appreciably faster variation than any of the other variables. 
This may be understood because the power deposition into the core naturally varies as the core cross-sectional area, 
so as the square of the core radius. In addition any increase in core radius causes a corresponding decrease in the 
shield thickness to maintain a constant overall radius for the central column. Thus the minimisation of the core radius 
is a key feature in any plant. The second most important term is the thermal vacuum gap thickness. Any increase here 
diminishes the shield thickness directly. It is seen that reducing the 0.03 m vacuum gap thickness assumed here would 
give a significant improvement. Increasing the plasma-wall gap is more complex as this alters the outer radius of the 
whole core region (<I>R<SUB>c</SUB></I>) and so besides reducing the shield thickness, increases the fusion power. 
However the net effect is closely similar to making changes in the vacuum gap thickness. 
Changes in the tie-bar thickness are made with the constraint of a constant superconducting core cross-sectional area. 
The end result is close to quadratic and is seen to give only a minor effect.

<P>Increasing the plasma major radius does cause an appreciable decrease in the deposited power and so 
suggests a clear solution if the deposited power is deemed too high. 

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>3. Water-cooling channel effects in the design of the neutron shield</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>In the first estimates for the Costley et al power plant design [2], a cylindrical tungsten carbide alloy shield 0.32 m 
thick was assumed, composed of 4 cylindrical water coolant layers of 0.0125 m thickness equally spaced within the shield. 
The water fraction <I>F<SUB>W</SUB></I> across the total thickness of the shield was thus 0.1875. 
A set of computations was made choosing 6 different cooling channel thicknesses to vary this fraction between 
0.094 and 0.28. The results are shown in table 2 and figure 3.

System Code. Plasma parameters do not change during the scan.</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>


<P>Although the scale of figure 3 is expanded, it shows a rather rapid increase in the power deposition if the water fraction 
is not within a relatively narrow range between 0.1 and 0.25. The optimum fraction is around 0.168. The line shows a 
parabolic fit to the data with an additional power deposition for a water fraction <I>F<SUB>W</SUB></I> equal to 
&#916;log<SUB>e</SUB><I>P<SUB>tot</SUB></I> = 0.715(<I>F<SUB>W</SUB></I>   -  0.168)2 in MW units. This term may also be added to the square bracket of equation 1. 
Again this relationship can be expected to hold only for configurations not far from the reference plant variables. 

<P>A second set of computations was carried out to consider whether it would be preferable to have unequal water-cooling 
spaces across the shield. In table 3 and figure 4 are shown the results for the power deposition as a function of the ratio 
of the cooling channel thickness next to the core divided by the mean thickness. The power deposition is reduced 
if the thickness of the water layer nearest to the core is greater than the average thickness. Clearly the extra moderating 
capability of the water layers is preferable nearest to the core rather than nearest to the plasma.  There is an optimum in 
the thickness next to the superconducting core at about 1.66 times the average water thickness, when the power deposition 
is reduced by about 9%.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>4. The choice and distribution of the neutron shield material</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>The earlier paper [1] considered several possible materials for the neutron and gamma shield necessary to limit 
both the heating and the radiation damage of the superconducting core. These included water, hydrocarbon, 
zirconium borohydride, and manganese/europium iodide, but excluded pure tungsten. A tungsten carbide alloy 
combines the good gamma shielding properties of the tungsten with the good moderation properties of carbon. 
The gamma shielding is dependent on the overall density, which is 19.25 g/cm3 for pure tungsten, and 15.63 g/cm3 
for tungsten carbide. Good moderation requires low atomic weight materials such as carbon or hydrogen.

<P>A different mode of shielding is to use atoms with a high absorption cross section such as boron. The isotope 
10B in particular has a large neutron absorption cross section varying from 600 barns at 1 eV to around a barn at 10 MeV. 
Tungsten boride alloys have been prepared in a similar way to those of tungsten carbide although they could be more 
expensive and difficult to manufacture. Another possible advantage is that it has more favourable oxidation properties.  
Tungsten carbide oxidises to volatile CO<SUB>2</SUB> whereas tungsten boride refractory metal borides, (with appropriate silicon 
additions) can form very stable borosilicate glasses [4,5].

<P>The phase diagram of tungsten boride is complex with several possible compounds. This study concentrates on WB, 
which was found to be more favourable than WB2 suggesting  that the heavy tungsten is the most useful atom. 
Table 4 and figure 5 gives cause for optimism in the superconducting core shield design.  Firstly the pure tungsten 
shield material (with water cooling) gives a power deposition some 18% lower than tungsten carbide. However a 
uniformly spaced shield of tungsten boride is seen to be considerably better being some 35% lower than tungsten carbide. 
Bi-tungsten boride is also better than the carbide by 26% but it appears to have no advantage over tungsten boride 
and will not be considered further.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>


<P>	Because tungsten boride particularly captures lower energy neutrons it might be better placed in the inner side 
of the shield next to the superconducting core. An MCNP computation was made with just the inner of the five cylinders 
of the shield composed of tungsten boride with the outer four cylinders nearest to the plasma being made of tungsten carbide. 
A 29% reduction of the power deposition into the core was obtained. Putting the tungsten boride on the outer, 
plasma side of the shield, where its volume is much larger, gave almost no improvement in the power deposition. 
Replacing more of the carbide layers with boride gives only a minor improvement as shown in figure 5 although 
replacing 4 out of 5 layers gave the best, 36% reduction. Having a single inner boron carbide layer with unequal 
water spacing gave a 34% reduction as shown by the open circle.

<P>These terms have been incorporated into the System Code but the additions have mostly been made around 
the major radius <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=1.35 m corresponding to the pilot plant proposed in [2]. Other plants with different major radii 
are of importance and four further MCNP computations have been made as listed in table 5 and plotted against
major radius in figure 6. It is seen the Monte Carlo code computations generally agree well with the System Code 
well near the reference design, but less well far away.

The power deposition into the superconducting core for several tokamaks as a function of their major radius. 
The points and line are the System Code predictions and the crosses the MCNP computations. 
The Princeton point is an attempt to reproduce their 1.4 m radius study [6] with a 3.2T toroidal field, 
around 100 MW fusion power and 1 MW/m2 wall loading. The 2.13 m point an attempt to model a design with around 
2 m major radius with a 0.58 m thick shield giving only around 3 kW of energy deposition. Slimmer superconductor 
cores have a maximum field on the conductor above 25 T. In this plot the Petty H factor is allowed to vary from 1.73 
at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=1.35 m to 0.95 at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=2.13 m. All computations have the other input parameters listed in table 1 constant 
and satisfy the defined density and beta limits. </B></font>

		
<P>An important engineering concern is the maximum field <I>B<SUB>cond</SUB></I>  that can be allowed on 
the superconductor. This will generally be at the outer surface of the superconducting core and will determine the 
maximum toroidal field at the plasma centre. If the maximum field is chosen too high for a given operating temperature 
then the probability of a quench is increased. If it is set too low then the performance of the magnet will be diminished. 
This is illustrated in figure 7 which shows the change in the Petty 2008 H factor[7] as the maximum field on the 
superconductor is varied. The variables mostly correspond to their reference values, and indeed the fusion and 
deposited powers are unchanged. However the toroidal field increases from 2.96 to 
4.44 T across the plot. The plasma pressure increases and the H factor decreases, leading to a greater fusion gain.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>6.  The dependence of the power deposition on plasma radius and other variables</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>Using the Tokamak Energy System Code, Version 5 updated on 04/06/2015, and including the parameterised 
power deposition defined in equation 2 it has been possible to predict how the power deposition into the central 
column depends on other key parameters of a pilot plant. The following assumptions were made. A tie-bar 
radius <I>r<SUB>tie</SUB></I> = 0.05 m was used, with a vacuum gap <I>d<SUB>vac</SUB></I> = 0.03 m, and a plasma wall gap 0.05 m. 
These constraints for a major radius <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=1.35 m and a superconducting core radius <I>r<SUB>sc</SUB></I>=0.20 m gave a 
power deposition <I>P<SUB>tot</SUB></I>=53.2 kW with a neutron shield thickness <I>d<SUB>shield</SUB></I>=0.32 m.  Working from this starting point 
it is possible to investigate the change in deposited power with a series of other variables.

<P>The confinement time is an important variable, since the ratio of the energy confinement time to its scaling law 
prediction defines the H factor, which is important in reaching fusion energy gain. Generally fusion gain will be 
possible at lower fusion powers

<P>if the energy confinement time is higher than that found from the scaling laws, that is H>1, and operation at low 
fusion power is essential for smaller devices. The H factor according to the formalism of Petty in 2008 [7] for the 
<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=1.35 m reference pilot plant configuration with the above engineering conditions was 1.563. This corresponds 
to 1.98 against the ITER IPB98y2 scaling. 

<P>Extending the major radius beyond the 1.35 m for the proposed pilot plant may well be a necessary condition 
if the high temperature superconductors need extra shielding protection to reduce radiation damage [8]. 
It is therefore prudent to consider using the System Code to evaluate the power deposition as a function of major radius. 
Major radius is an output parameter of the System Code so the scans are made varying the radius of the 
central column (<I>R<SUB>c</SUB></I>). The increase in major radius can be achieved by increasing either the shield thickness 
or the superconducting core radius, or a combination of both. It is possible to do this while keeping many parameters 
constant including, for example, the fusion gain and the tokamak aspect ratio, while keeping constant some chosen 
parameter such as the deposited power, the radius of the superconducting core or the fusion power. 

<P><IMG SRC="Fig8.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B>Figure 8.</B> The required Petty[7] H factor, or ratio of the energy confinement time to the value predicted from scaling laws, 
plotted against plasma major radius for (i) a constant deposited power <I>P<SUB>tot</SUB></I>=53.6 kW: (ii) a constant superconducting 
core radius of <I>r<SUB>sc</SUB></I>=0.2 m and (iii) a constant fusion power Pfus=175 MW achieved by adjusting the wall loading. 
In all cases the central temperature and toroidal field have been adjusted to give the defined density and beta limits. 
Other variables are kept constant as in table 1.</FONT>  

<P>Figure 8 shows the dependence of the Petty[7] H factor on tokamak major radius according to three assumed 
conditions. The black open triangles show the rapidly reducing H factor obtained if the scan is performed at a 
constant deposited power. This is achieved by changing the wall loading to keep the deposited power at the 
reference value 53.6 kW. The red circles, having a slower decrease in H factor with radius, is the calculation with 
constant central core radius and varying shield thickness. An identical curve is obtained by varying the core radius 
at constant shield thickness since the plasma conditions are unchanged. The deposited power varies from 0.135 to 
0.054 kW across this curve. The blue triangles correspond to varying the wall loading until the fusion power equals 
the constant value 175 MW of the 1.35 m major radius reference pilot plant. The small change in H factor is in 
accordance with predictions that fusion power and the H factor are the key variables in determining the 
tokamak power gain [2,9]. The deposited power reduces from 0.170 MW to 0.010 MW across this curve.
 
<P>A conclusion from figure 8 is that increasing the plasma radius at constant fusion gain generally requires a lower 
H factor primarily because the fusion power is increasing. The most favourable engineering design will generally use 
the minimum H factor. In the following computations to explore the variation of deposited power with the plasma 
major radius, a condition will be made that the Petty[7] H factor is kept at a fixed value, taken here at the value 
HPetty:2008=1.563 of the reference design [2]. This is achieved by adjusting the wall loading input parameter 
so that the constant H factor is maintained.

The power deposition into the superconducting core as a function of plasma major radius for the condition 
that the Petty H factor HPetty=1.573. The changes in toroidal field, maximum field on the superconductor, fusion power, 
shield thickness and wall loading are also shown. The circled points show the <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=1.35 m case used to define the 
constant Petty H factor. Other input variables are kept constant, with the values of table 1, except where adjusted to 
give the appropriate density and beta limits. The open squares show an exponential fit to the power deposition showing 
a factor 10 decrease for each 0.307 m increase in major radius.</FONT>

<P>In figure 9 an approach is taken where output results from the System Code are plotted as a function of the plasma 
major radius under the assumption that the H factor remains constant. As many as possible of the input variables are 
kept constant. In particular the superconducting core is kept at a constant radius and carries a constant total current 
so that its construction need not be changed. To keep the assumed H factor constant, the wall loading input parameter 
is changed. Figure 9 shows the power deposition reducing by two orders of magnitude from 53.6 to 0.4 kW as the 
radius increases from 1.35 to 2 m and the shield thickness increases from 0.32 to 0.61 m.  
At the same time the fusion power reduces only slightly from 175 to 161 MW and the toroidal field at the major 
radius of the plasma is reduced from 3.7 to 2.6 T. The maximum field on the superconductor increases slightly 
from 24.7 T to 25.9 T. The decrease in power deposition is well represented by an exponential decrease 
with a 1/10 decrease every 0.307 m shown by the open black squares.

<P>There are many other important input variables whose effect on the power deposition into the centre column 
may be evaluated using the System Code.  Examples of such results are given in figure 10 which shows the 
power deposition plotted against the relative changes of aspect ratio, fusion gain, elongation, triangularity, density and 
beta limit fractions. 
Each of the variables starts from the assumed reference conditions of the pilot plant.
At each point the wall loading is adjusted to give the reference Petty[7] H factor of 1.5733. 
It is seen that the power deposition is decreased by increasing the elongation or beta limit fraction, and reduced 
by increasing the aspect ratio or the fusion gain. It is little changed by changes in triangularity or the   density limit fraction. 
Of these the greatest effects are from reducing the aspect ratio and increasing the elongation - two factors which 
tend to go together naturally.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>7. Conclusions</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       


<P>Earlier calculations of the power deposition into the core of a superconducting tokamak using the MCNP code 
have been extended to optimise the design of the neutron shield and to include several engineering details. 
They suggest an optimal neutron shield could be a mixture of tungsten carbide layers with intervening water-cooling 
layers with about 17% of water. The water layer thickness has been optimised: too thin a water layer gives 
insufficient moderation, too thick gives insufficient gamma attenuation. The layer radial spacing has been optimised: 
a thicker spacing close to the core gives moderation where it is needed, while a thinner spacing next to the plasma 
gives better gamma shielding. Shield materials have been optimised: the inclusion of tungsten boride into a tungsten 
carbide shield is shown to give appreciably lower power deposition, especially in the layer next to the core. 
Next to the superconducting core the water layers should be thicker, and neutron absorbing tungsten boride becomes 
advantageous compared to tungsten carbide. The results have been modelled and incorporated into the 
Tokamak Energy System Code as a step towards the optimisation of the physics and engineering of a pilot plant. 
For example the Petty[7] scaling H factor required for a given fusion gain is shown to drop rapidly with plasma radius 
at constant deposited power, but less rapidly at constant core size, and to become almost independent of radius 
at constant fusion power. Maintaining the Petty[7] scaling H factor at a constant reference level of 1.563, it is shown 
that the power deposition decreases by two orders of magnitude as the major radius increases from 1.35  to 2.0 m. 
Under similar conditions it is shown that the deposited power rises with superconducting core radius, aspect ratio 
and fusion gain but falls with increasing elongation and beta limit fraction. It is not strongly dependent on the 
triangularity or density limit fraction.

<P>The results presented here suggest that a relatively inexpensive spherical tokamak of 1.35 m radius would 
have a 53 kW power deposition into its superconducting core. This could be extracted by a feasible cryogenic 
power of 2.8 MW. Reducing the plasma radius at constant superconducting core radius and aspect ratio puts 
up the cryogenic costs, while increasing it puts up the cost of the superconducting tapes and general engineering costs. 
However other factors, such as mechanical stress and diverter load, outside the scope of this paper, could 
change the optimal radius. Another uncertainty is the effect of radiation damage on the superconductors, which 
may require the deposited power to be appreciably decreased. Our results suggest that each increase of shielding 
thickness by 0.307 m reduces the power deposition by an order of magnitude.

<P>The first is the thickness of the vacuum gap <I>d<SUB>vac</SUB></I> needed to insulate the cold superconducting core from the 
neutron shield. Table A1 shows the raw results for the power deposition into the superconducting core for vacuum gaps 
from zero to 0.06 m. These results include no tie-bar or plasma-wall gap. Outside the vacuum gap is an enclosing neutron 
shield which is changed in thickness to maintain the total thickness of the centre column constant.

The power deposition variation is close to exponential and so appears linear on a log plot.  
The small vertical displacement arises because the superconducting core radius <I>r<SUB>sc</SUB></I> was 0.23 m rather than 0.20 m.

<P>The power depositions into both the tie-bar and the rest of the superconducting core were evaluated separately 
but the power deposition into the tie-bar was only some 3% of the total for a tie-bar radius of 0.05 m.  
In figure A2 the triangles show the total power deposition from the tie-bar plotted against the square of the tie-bar radius. 
Note the greatly expanded vertical scale. The actual change in power deposition on including a 0.05m radius tie-bar 
is only about 2% so that the tie-bar, with its comparatively small cross-sectional area, does not make an important contribution. 
The line in figure A2 shows the System Code prediction with the addition of a term

Plotted against the square of the tie-bar radius the fit is roughly linear but the changes are small and so are 
probably affected by statistical error.</B></font>



<P>A third engineering addition to be considered is the plasma-wall gap. This includes the tokamak "first wall" 
with any vacuum vessel and plasma-facing tiles needed to withstand the presence of the plasma. 
No further MCNP runs need to be done for this addition, since its space may taken up by a reduction in the neutron 
shield thickness.

<P>Another important engineering question is the vertical distribution of the power deposition into the superconducting core. 
The concentration of the neutron production near the mid-plane of the plasma means that the power deposition 
into the core is concentrated here too and it is important to know the form of the vertical profile of the power deposition.

<P>As in earlier computations the superconducting core was 0.2 m in radius and simplified to represent a uniform 
density of a mixture of Hastelloy and copper with 25% by volume of liquid neon cooling, around a 0.05 m radius steel tie rod.  
The neutron shield was of total thickness 0.32 m and composed of 5 equal layers of shield 
(tungsten or tungsten carbide alloy) 0.052 m thick, and 4 layers of pure water 0.015 m thick. 
Since the plasma is vertically symmetric, the sectors at equal distances from the mid-plane should give similar results, 
but the statistical nature of Monte Carlo calculations means that the results are not exactly symmetric. 
The two outer segments are actually within the top and bottom shields.

<P>The plasma description, as superposed toroids of elliptical cross section, was enhanced to describe more 
accurately the vertical distribution of neutron production. The revised description included 12 toroids whose 
description follows SCENE code computations [10], and approximates the Miller description with four parameters, 
major radius (<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>), minor radius <I>(a)</I>, vertical radius <I>(b)</I> and intensity (<I>I</I>), 
for each shell. 
These parameters are shown in table A4. The first "zero" shell is only used for illustration as it has no volume, 
and it is seen that the last five shells have very low intensity compared to the first six. 

<P><IMG SRC="FigA3.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B>Figure A3.</B> 
The power deposited into the cryogenic tie-bar and superconducting core plotted against the mean 
vertical height as a function of the elliptical cross section toroid number with a tungsten carbide alloy shield with water cooling.  
The corresponding elliptical cross sections are shown on the right.</FONT>

<P>MCNP computations were performed for each of the toroidal volumes described by the spaces between toroidal surfaces. 
Combined with an assumed radial intensity profile, this enables the three-dimensional neutron production profile to be defined. 
The raw MCNP results are expressed as the energy deposited per fusion neutron produced per gram of target material 
for each vertical segment, and also for the three volumes of the tie-bar, superconducting core and shield. 
For the present purposes we consider the total power deposition summed over the tie-bar and core volumes, 
which defines the cryogenic power removal requirement.  


<P><IMG SRC="FigA4.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B>Figure A4.</B>
 The power deposited into the tie-bar and superconducting core for each of the 12 toroidal sections 
defined in table 5 for tungsten carbide (triangles) and pure tungsten (open circles) shields with water cooling. 
The crosses show the composite total power deposition when all sectors are summed with the appropriate area 
and intensity values. </FONT>

<P>Figure A4 shows these deposited powers for each of the volumes between the elliptical cross section toroids, 
as a function of the outer toroid number, for a tungsten carbide alloy and shield with water-cooling. 
The first three inner toroids give a Gaussian-like distribution, but the larger toroids show a double-peak distribution. 
The areas under the curves of figure A3 representing the total energy deposition per neutron produced varies by only 
about 10% as shown in figure A4. Because of the concentration of the neutron production into the first few toroids 
these have by far the greatest influence, and the crosses in figure A4 show the total energy deposition evaluated 
by a summation weighted by area and neutron intensity. It is seen that they are within 3% of the power deposition 
from just the first toroid. Elsewhere in this paper the approximation of using just this central toroid has been adopted.

<P>The vertical distribution of power deposition is calculated by multiplying the deposited powers for each vertical 
section as shown in figure A3 by the relevant toroidal volumes and the normalised neutron intensities from table A4. 
Because the sectors are of different heights they must be expressed as power deposition per metre as shown by 
the solid triangles for tungsten carbide in figure A5. The open circles in figure A5 shows a similar computation 
with identical geometrical sizes but using pure tungsten instead of tungsten carbide alloy in the neutron shield. 
The height distribution is seen to be very similar but the deposited power is only 83% of that from the tungsten carbide 
alloy

<P>For modelling purposes, the distributions in figure A5 are quite well fitted by the Gaussian distribution shown by the 
dashed line whose full width at half height is 2 m.

the Gaussian function shown dashed with a full width at half height of 2 m.</FONT>
