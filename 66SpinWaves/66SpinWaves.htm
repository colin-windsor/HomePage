<B><P>1. Introduction </B>

<P>The spin-wave dispersion relations of a magnetic salt can be found by observing inelastic 
scattering collisions in which some of the energy and momentum of an incident neutron is 
used in exciting a spin wave. If these measurements are performed at low temperatures, when 
spin-wave theory is applicable, the exchange interactions between the magnetic ions may be deduced 
from the spin-wave energies.

<P>The salt RbMnF<SUB>3</SUB> has the cubic perovskite structure in which the manganese ions 
lie on a simple cubic lattice. The lattice constant was redetermined using X rays and found to have 
the value <I>a<SUB>o</SUB></I> = 4.2396 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#177;</FONT> 0.0002 A at room temperature. 
Below 82 <SUP>o</SUP>K the salt becomes antiferromagnetic with the spin directions alternating 
along cube edges. RbMnF<SUB>3</SUB> is of particular interest in that, unlike many magnetic salts 
of cubic symmetry, there is no measurable distortion of the lattice in the antiferromagnetic state.

<P>The ordering structure determines the periodicity of the spin-wave dispersion relations in 
reciprocal space. Figure 1 shows the 110 plane of the reciprocal lattice of a simple cubic 
antiferromagnet. Nuclear reflection points (all indices integral) are determined by the 
chemical cell and lie on a simple cubic lattice of side <I>2<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT>/a<SUB>o</SUB></I>. 
Magnetic reflection points (all indices half-integral) are determined by the magnetic unit cell 
and occupy the corresponding body-centred positions. The Brillouin zones defining the symmetry 
of the spin-wave dispersion relations are found by drawing perpendicular bisectors between 
adjacent lattice points. In three dimensions the zones are truncated octahedra.

<P>
<P><B>2. Experimental details</B>

<P>The experiments were performed on the twin-rotor neutron chopper described by Dyer and Low (1961). 
This instrument uses mechanical velocity selection and a time-of-flight method to determine the 
incident and scattered neutron momentum vectors respectively. The energy <I>E<B>q</I></B> needed to 
excite a spin wave vector <B><I>q</I></B> is then found using the energy and momentum conservation laws. 
Incident neutron energies corresponding to 105 <SUP>o</SUP>K (3.00 A) and 170 <SUP>o</SUP>K (2.34 A) were used.

<P>The sample used in these experiments was a single crystal of volume 0.2 cm<SUP>3</SUP> which was cut 
from a multicrystal grown by the Stockbarger method. The crystal was mounted in a helium cryostat 
and aligned so that spin waves propagating in a 110 plane were observed. The counter and crystal 
angles were then set so that the neutron wave vector transfer <B><I>K</I></B> lay in the (1/2,1/2,1/2) 
zone, as shown in figure 1. The spin-wave intensity decreases away from the magnetic reflection point 
at the centre of the zone. Near the zone boundary 24-hour runs gave just observable intensities. 
Spin-wave peaks with a statistical probability less than 2.8 standard deviations were rejected.

very small anisotropy field. </DIR></DIR></FONT>


<B><P>3. Results</B>

<P>Figure 2 shows spin waves with <I><B>q</I></B> vectors distributed over the 110 plane. Spin-wave 
theory predicts that the dispersion curve depends on the exchange interactions 
<I>2J<SUB>ij</SUB><B>S</B><SUB>i</SUB><B>S</B><SUB>j</SUB></I> between first, second and third neighbours, and the 
anisotropy field <I>H<SUB>a</SUB></I> according to

Here <I>S</I> is the spin on each ion and <I>a<SUB>0</SUB></I> is the lattice constant of the chemical cell. 
The theory of spin-wave interactions (Oguchi 1960) predicts that these energies should be increased by 
the factor (1+0.097/2<I>S</I>) or 1.02. However, this part of the theory has yet to receive any 
experimental verification. A least-squares fit to the data taking into account the exact direction of all the 
<B><I>q</I></B> vectors gave the following parameters:

<P>Experimental standard errors are quoted. The figures may also be affected by any biquadratic term
<I>-2j<SUB>ij</SUB>(<B>S</B><SUB>i</SUB><B>S</B><SUB>j</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP></I>  in the exchange 
Hamiltonian which would reduce the results by a factor l + 2<I>S<SUP>2</SUP>j/J</i> (Harris and Owen 1963). 
The very small value of the energy intercept at <i><b>q</I></b> = 0 reflects the fact that the 
anisotropy field is very small. The antiferro-magnetic resonance results of Teaney et al. (1962) showed 
this to be only 4.5 gauss, and our experiments confirm that it is less than 400 gauss. This low value 
is a consequence of the cubic symmetry giving a vanishing dipolar field.


<P><B>4. Paramagnetic scattering results</B>

<P>Following the above studies, paramagnetic neutron scattering experiments have been performed using 
the same instrument, but with a larger poly crystalline sample kept at room temperature 
(<I>T/T<SUB>N</SUB> = 3.7)</I>. The exchange interaction causes the scattered neutrons to have an energy 
spread approximating to a Gaussian distribution (de Gennes 1958). With the assumption that 
<I>J<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> << J<SUB>1</SUB><SUP>2</SUP></I>, measurements of the width of this 
distribution give the exchange interaction <I>J<SUB>1</SUB> = 3.2 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#177;</FONT>0.3 <SUP>o</SUP>K. </I>
Full details will be published elsewhere.

<P><B>5. Discussion</B>
<P>The spin-wave results show that the bulk properties of RbMnF<SUB>3</SUB> may be interpreted on 
the basis of a single nearest-neighbour exchange interaction. This confirms the paramagnetic 
resonance results of Windsor (1963, D.Phil. Thesis, Oxford University), which showed that for Mn<SUP>2+ </SUP>
pairs in the isomorphous diamagnetic salt KMgF<SUB>3</SUB> the ratio 
<I>J<SUB>2</SUB>/J<SUB>1</SUB></I> was 0.01 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#177;</FONT>0.006. The table 
shows the present experimental value of <I>J<SUB>1</SUB></I> compared with other experimental values, 
and with values calculated from a Neel temperature of 82.6 <SUP>o</SUP>K (Moruzzi and Teaney 1964).

<P>The good agreement suggests that biquadratic exchange effects are not of great importance in this salt.  
RbMnF<SUB>3</SUB> thus appears to be one of the simplest of magnetic salts.
