<P><B><I>Abstract</I>  A method is presented for isolating the overlapping hyperbolic arcs found when a radar scan 
is made over several adjacent buried objects. The reflected signal is first converted into a series of data pairs

The generalised Hough transform method has been extended to record in an associative store the sets of data pairs contributing to each bin in the Hough accumulator space. A cluster of high bins, defining a peak in this space, may then be broken down into its contributing data pairs. This gives the important advantage that conventional least squares algorithm can be used to reveal the object position, depth, and radius or velocity. The method is demonstrated on real radar data from buried pipes. The radius of a 0.18m radius concrete pipe at 1m depth is estimated at 0.14m. </B>

<P>I. INTRODUCTION

<P>THE LOCATION of buried targets from ground penetrating
radar data is a common problem for nondestructive
evaluation of civil structures [1], concrete [2], soil [3],
archaeology [4], and for landmine detection [5]. Here, we
present a method that is able to isolate the radar reflection
from a particular buried object. For example, in surface scans
perpendicular to several buried pipes, each buried pipe gives
a wavelet of reflections, forming inverted hyperbolic arcs
that may overlap to give a complex pattern. Human eyes
are generally good at separating these arcs, but automatic
characterization is not easy. Mathematically, to determine the
real space positions of the pipes from the reflected radar
pattern is an inverse problem of some complexity. Standard
treatments include synthetic aperture focussing [6], frequency
domain field inversion [6], genetic algorithms [7], and neural
networks [8].

<P>The Hough transform originated in image analysis [9] with
two variables. The extended Hough transform using more variablesfs
was used in radar time of flight in [10], and extended to
pipes of finite diameter in [11]–[14]. In a recent comprehensive
analysis [15], the general case of pipes at a given position <I>Y</I> ,
depth <I>Z</I>, radius <I>R</I>, measured in a medium of unknown velocity
<I>V</I> , was considered.

<P>II. EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENT FOR RADAR DETECTION OF BURIED OBJECTS

<P>A radar antenna, placed just above the surface, is scanned
across the objects to give a B-scan, defining the reflected
intensity <I>S(y, t)</I> as a function of the round-trip time of flight
<I>t</I> along the scan <I>Y</I> . Each buried object gives a generally
hyperbolic pattern as the range becomes a minimum when the
antenna is over the object, as shown in Fig. 1. This shows the
conventional B-scan representation of the reflected intensity as
a grey scale, representing reflected intensity, with time of flight
<I>t</I> vertical, and distance <I>Y</I>  across the road horizontal. The source
was a FC = 600 MHz central frequency pulsed RIS model
radar developed by the IDS company in Pisa, Italy [16]. The
image is acquired with a time sampling of TS = 2.5 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP>s,
and with a lateral step of 0.01 m. The average soil velocity
V was estimated at 1.23 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP> and so the wavelength
<span style='font-family:Symbol' SIZE=5>l</span></font>C = V/FC = 0.205m and the time sampling TS corresponds to
a distance V.TS/2 = 0.0154m. The problem is that in general
there are many overlapping signals from the different buried
objects, and many spurious signals arising from extraneous
objects, such as stones, and from layered structures in the
ground. The location was a test ground, and the nature of
some objects was known. The inverted hyperbola in the center
(denoted by <I>B</I> in Fig. 1) is known to be from a concrete
pipe 0.36m in diameter, buried at a depth of about 1m. The
reflection on the right-hand side, (<I>C</I>), is from an electric utility
cable of 0.08-m diameter. The nature of the strong reflection to
the left (<I>A</I>) is unknown. The different nature of the reflecting
objects is shown by the phase of the principal reflected signal.
The concrete pipe gives a dark-phase principal reflection with
ringing satellite arcs above and below. The other two objects
have a light-phase principal reflection with weaker satellites.
The problem faced is clear. The reflections from the three
main objects overlap to a considerable degree. Also there is
considerable clutter noise from the nature of the soil, and to
the top of the figure, rather intense flat signals representing the
layered structure of the road. Presented here is an automatic
method for isolating the reflected signals from any one object.


<P>III. GENERATION OF DATA PAIRS LEADING TO THE GENERALIZED HOUGH TRANSFORM

<P>The first step, as illustrated by the light and dark circles in
Fig. 2, is to reduce the B-scan to two sets of discrete data pairs
<I>(y<SUB>j</SUB>, t<SUB>j</SUB>)</I>, at the positions, where the B-scan reflected intensity
is maximum or minimum. The light and dark phase sets may
be considered separately. In general, we have four unknown
parameters for any buried pipe: 1) its position <I>Y</I> across the
road; 2) its depth <I>Z</I>; 3) its radius <I>R</I>; and 4) the radar velocity
of the soil <I>V</I>. The forward solution relating <I>y</I> and <I>t</I> for these
unknown parameters is

<P><I>V t<SUB>j</SUB>/2= [(y<SUB>j</SUB> - Y)<SUP>2</SUP> + Z<SUP>2</SUP>] <SUP>1/2</SUP> -  R.  </I>    (1)

<P>Note that it is assumed the time scale is measured from main
bang reflection from the surface of the soil. In the generalized
Hough transform, a problem with <I>n</I> unknown parameters is
solved by randomly choosing n data pairs <I>(y<SUB>j</SUB>, t<SUB>j</SUB>), j = 1, n</I>
from the complete data and using analytic methods to solve
for the <I>n</I> unknown parameters <I>X<SUB>j</SUB> , j = 1, n</I>. An n-dimensional
accumulator space is set up and incremented by 1 at the position
[<I>X<SUB>j</SUB></I>]. The process is repeated many times with different
random choices of data pairs until a significant peak is seen at
the accumulator space. This peak defines the probable values
of the <I>n</I> unknown parameters.

<P><IMG SRC="DataLabelFig2.jpg" >
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Fig. 2. Bright phase data pairs are shown by the dark circles. The Hough
accumulator space in the variables <I>Y</I> and <I>Z</I> derived from these is superimposed
as a grey scale. This has been normalized so that the maximum accumulator
bin is black. Peaks in the accumulator space are seen close to each object <I>A</I>,
<I>B</I>, and <I>C</I>.</FONT>

<P>In general, the more unknown variables to be found, the
more correlated the solutions. Therefore, we begin with the
simplest relevant case of a point object (<I>R = 0</I>) in soil whose
radar velocity may at least be estimated at a value <I>V=v</I>. In this
case, <I>n</I> = 2 and only doublet data pairs <I>(y<SUB>i</SUB>, t<SUB>i</SUB></I>) and 
<I>(y<SUB>j</SUB>, t<SUB>j</SUB>)</i> need
be chosen. The chosen points must be different, so that <I>i = j</I>.
Also note that when the points are different but very close, the
solution will be ill-conditioned, and the solution will not be
so accurate. The solutions for the unknown variables <I>Y</I> and <I>Z</I>

<P><I> Y = [(y<SUB>i</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> - y<SUB>j</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>) - (t<SUB>i</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> - t<SUB>j</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>)v<SUP>2</SUP>/4)]/[2(y<SUB>i</SUB> - y<SUB>j</SUB>)]

<P>Z = (vt<SUB>i</SUB>/2)<SUP>2</SUP> - (y<SUB>i</SUB> - Y)<SUP>2</SUP>. </I>  (2)

<P>In this case, the accumulator space is only 2-D and is easily
plotted in real space [<I>Y, Z</I>]. Fig. 2 shows such an accumulator
space for the bright phase data pairs of Fig. 1. The results are
for 100 000 random choices of data pairs. The spatial resolution
of the accumulator space <I>DY</I> = 0.02m in the direction of
the scan, and <I>DZ</I> = 0.015m in depth. These values are comparable
with the lateral step of 0.01m and the time sampling
distance of 0.015 m. Many of the iterations are not recorded
and do not result in any increment to the accumulator space.
For example, the solution may be imaginary, or the range of
the solutions may lie outside specified ranges of interest.
It is seen from Fig. 2 that the accumulator space shows a
number of significant dark areas indicating the positions of
hyperbolic arc apexes, including each of the three principal
hyperbolas denoted by <I>A</I>,
<I>B</I>, and <I>C</I> in Fig. 1. There is also
a background of ignorance at around the 10% level, covering
most of the area near the apex points. This background arises
from plausible solutions, arising from data pair choices where
one point may lie on the hyperbola of interest but the other lies
on a different hyperbola, on a noise signal or on a soil layer
signal. The resulting background may center on the apex of
interest, but extends at a relatively uniform level over a wide
area.

<P>IV. LABELING OF DATA-PAIRS USING A HOUGH ASSICIATIVE STORE

<P>The accumulator space is conventionally an array with
dimensionality equal to the number of unknown parameters.
An integer array is conventionally chosen with each unknown
variable being appropriately digitized with a step size <I>X<SUB>i</SUB></I>
for each variable <I>X<SUB>i</SUB></I>. An associative store is mathematically
equivalent, but instead is a series of linear integer arrays,
with one array describing the digitized value of each unknown
parameter, and one accumulator array describing the number
of hits for that set of variables <I>X<SUB>i</SUB></I>. Each Hough iteration,
with a new random choice of data pairs and solutions <I>X<SUB>i</SUB></I>,
first produces a fresh member <I>j</i> of the associative store,
with an initial accumulator value of 1. However, after the
first iteration, the solutions <I>X<SUB>i</SUB></I> are examined to see if any
of the existing members of the store corresponds to the
current solution. If this happens, then the existing accumulator
value is incremented by 1. The associative method has many
advantages in Hough solutions with highly peaked solutions.
In this letter, a second associative store has been introduced
with the objective of recording all contributing data pairs. It
is composed of a new series of digital arrays whose index <I>k</I> is
incremented for each recorded Hough iteration. For <I>n</I> unknown
variables, these arrays record the indices <I>j(i), i = 1, n</I> of each
of the <I>n</I> data pairs <I>(y<SUB>j</SUB>, t<SUB>j</SUB>)</I>, contributing to each recorded
iteration. A further index associates the recorded iteration
number <I>k</I> with each bin <I>j</I> of the main associative store. The
extra storage and computation causes no significant issues on
a standard personal computer and the programs reported here
run in only a few seconds.

<P>The objective is to identify peaks in the Hough accumulator
space and so to locate the contributing data pairs that define
the hyperbolic arc arising from a given defect. The method
used is to define for <I>n</I> unknown variables <I>X<SUB>i</SUB></I> a hyper-radius
<I>R=  <span style='font-family:Symbol' SIZE=5>S</span></font><SUB< i=1,n </SUB>a<SUB>i</SUB> (<I>X<SUB>i</SUB></I>-X<SUB>0i</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP></I>, where the amplitudes <I>a<SUB>i</SUB></I> are chosen
according to the spread of the variable to include the most
appropriate cluster of large amplitude bins in the accumulator
space. Bins lying within this radius are defined as belonging
to the arc apex, provided that their amplitude is above a
defined lower limit, say 20% of the peak amplitude. This
figure is a compromise between including all the data pairs
associated with a defect and rejecting false alarm pairs that
only spuriously occur within the proscribed hyper-radius. In
Fig. 3, the maximum included radius has been chosen as
four bins along both <I>Y</I> and <I>Z</I> axes. These included bins are
shown by closed squares, and the contributing data points from
all bins defined as belonging to the apex are indicated by
closed triangles. It is seen that the merged bins form a close
cluster, and that the chosen contributing data pairs form a fair
representation of the arc.

<P><IMG SRC="DataLabelFig3.jpg" >
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> Fig. 3. Contributing data pairs for object <I>C</I> are shown by the closed dark
triangles. The crosses are data pairs deleted by the threshold on contribution
numbers. The results of a three-unknown parameter least-squares fit are
shown. The full line is the best fit given by these parameters. At the top
of the figure, the residuals are shown on a five-times expanded scale.</FONT>

<P>V. CONVENTIONAL LEAST-SQUARES FITTING TOFIND THE SOIL VELOCITY

<P>Now that the data pairs contributing to object <I>C</I> have been
delineated, conventional least-squares fitting to (1) becomes
feasible. Since it is known that object <I>C</I> is an electric cable
of only 0.04-m diameter, we may assume that it is a point
scattering source (<I>R = 0</I>) and fit simultaneously to the three
remaining parameters: object position <I>Y</I>, depth <I>Z</I>, and soil
velocity <I>V</I>. This enables the radar velocity to be defined for
this region of the soil as <I>V</I> = 1.142 × 108 ms<SUP>-1</SUP>. Now that



the first object hyperbola and its contributing points have
been defined, a search may be made for further hyperbolas.
However, since we have noted all the contributions to
the accumulator space from the data pairs contributing to
the first object, it is possible to scan through the whole
of the accumulator space, searching for, and deleting,
any contributions that have involved data pairs defined as
belonging to this object. This clear-out process lowers the
background of ignorance mentioned in Section III by removing
those contributions arising from the first object hyperbola.



<P>VI. FITTING A RADIUS TO THE CONCRETE PIPE <I>B</I> USING THE DARK PHASE DATA PAIRS

<P>The concrete pipe is better defined from the dark phase
data pairs, and the light circles in Fig. 4 show these as in
the B-scan in Fig. 2. The grey scale shows the corresponding
Hough accumulator space. This time, the highest bin in the
accumulator space is for peak B and the dark squares show
the merged high bins forming the cluster for apex B. A much
bigger cluster of high bins is now present and a radius of
eight bins proved necessary, twice the size used for the more
compact peak C. The simulated shape of a 0.18-m radius
pipe is shown in the right-hand top corner and confirms the
larger size of the cluster expected. Once again, the number of
contributions from each data point was thresholded. The closed
triangles show the contributing points after thresholding and
define the hyperbolic arc associated with this defect. The black
crosses show the data pairs removed by thresholding. The
thresholding process removed many data pairs whose affinity
with the hyperbolic arc was dubious.


<P><IMG SRC="DataLabelFig4.jpg" >
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> Fig. 4. Dark phase data pairs are shown by the light circles. The central
object B gave the largest contributions to the Hough accumulator space, shown
by the grey scale. The merged accumulator bins forming the apex are shown
by the dark squares. The contributing data pairs for object B are shown by
the dark triangles. The crosses are data pairs deleted by the threshold on
contribution numbers. The results of a three-unknown parameter least-squares
fit for the position <I>Y</I> , the depth Z, and the radius <I>R</I> at the velocity determined
from peak <I>C</I> give the values shown in the figure. The full line is the best fit
given by these parameters. At the base of the figure, the residuals are shown
on a five-times expanded scale. At the top right in black, a simulation of a
0.18m pipe measured on a <I>Y Z</I> Hough transform shows the true form of the
accumulator bin distribution.</FONT>

<P>This time, the velocity was assumed to be determined from
object <I>C</I>, as described in Section VI. With <I>V</I> held at the value
1.142 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP> determined from this fit, a least-squares fit
was made to the remaining three parameters: object position
<I>Y</I>, depth <I>Z</I>, and pipe radius <I>R</I>. The full line shows the best fit
to the contributing points, and the fitted parameters are shown.
The fit of the theoretical line to the contributing points is good.
It is noteworthy that the fitted radius of 0.14m is not far from
the actual value of 0.18 m.

<P>VII. CONCLUSION

<P>A generalized Hough transform method for locating buried
objects using radar was extended by recording in an associative
store the position/time data pairs that form a contribution to
any bin in the Hough accumulator space. By merging high
bins in the accumulator space, and noting the data pairs that
contribute to the peak, the data pairs lying on a hyperbolic arc
attributable to a particular object may be defined. Having defined
these data pairs, a conventional least-squares method may
be used to determine unknown parameters of the object. Using
real radar data from buried pipes, it was possible to identify
two known pipes and to evaluate to 25% accuracy the diameter
of a 0.36-m diameter buried concrete pipe at around 1-m depth.
