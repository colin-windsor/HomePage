<P>My clock said four, my clock said five,
<BR>This day we'd meet, I felt alive.
<BR>My clock said six, then six-fifteen,
<BR>I thought of happy times there'd been.
<BR>Then dear, Oh dear, six-forty eight
<BR>My lover would be at her gate!
<BR>I rushed, I ran, there was one stone
<BR>Upon the post, like me alone.
<BR>Remembering her fidelity,
<BR>The Rainbow Bower enfolded me.
