The prettiest heart</H1><P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#880000"><p>
<P>High upon the watershed we stand
<BR>Looking down and seeking out the land
<BR>The vista is superb where flows the river
<BR>Racing joyfully through woods on either hand.

<P>Enticing us who stand above
<BR>All breathless with the long slow climb,
<BR>To run on down and dive right in
<BR>To be submerged within its flow sublime.

<P>Then bring our eyes back to the topmost peak
<BR>The air is fresher there and we can breath.
<BR>There's singing in the wind, and music in the grass
<BR>Where all God's world with pleasures interweaves.
