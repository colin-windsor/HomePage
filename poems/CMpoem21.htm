Our Secret Garden</H1><P><HR>

<P>My lover knows a secret place,
<BR>A holy temple, filled with grace.
<BR>She has the key that lets us in,
<BR>To green and shady steps within
<BR>Which open to a chancel wide,
<BR>The river running by its side.
<BR>The holy altar are those stones
<BR>Which guard the river's danger zones.
<BR>No sound is there, except the birds
<BR>Who welcome us with heavenly words.
<BR>The dawn reveals her beauty fair.
<BR>The peace of nature settles there.
<BR>Our secret garden shrine is this.
<BR>My love and I embrace and kiss.
