<P>So cold, so cold, the earth was stone.
<BR>So dark, light from the stars alone.
<BR>Then from the black a figure came,
<BR>A girl, and then she called my name!
<BR>It was my lover, eyes so bright.
<BR>We hugged and held each other tight
<BR>Around the park we ran that morn
<BR>All in the dark before the dawn.
<BR>The memory will never die,
<BR>Nor will the love twixt you and I.
