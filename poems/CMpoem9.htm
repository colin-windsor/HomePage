Dark minutes </H1><P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#880000"><p>

<P>Dark minutes just before day comes, enfold and cushion against the world.
<BR>No sound! A wondrous anticipation as nature holds its breath.
<BR>Trees along the bank show off their winter lacy patterns against the early dawning sky
<BR>Age-old and watching, ever waiting for the spring,
<BR>They watch two lovers run into each other's souls 
<BR>To recompense their hours of separate longing.
<BR>The song that grows within their hearts echoes
<BR>The growing orchestra of bird sounds waking to another perfect joyous day.
<BR>Beloved earth, beloved trees and nature, all these are sacred to the lovers now
<BR>For they have seen the secret and will keep it in their hearts for ever, like their love.
