<P>Morning come, my love is there
<BR>Gentle touch to bodies bare
<BR>Breakfast healthy, mousli, egg
<BR>Better start no man could beg

<P>Down the ping pong, up the net
<BR>Crash the balls: you win I bet!
<BR>On the fire: off the clothes
<BR>Exercises warm our toes

<P>Happy singing later on
<BR>Friendship true music has won
<BR>Bed-y-byes, no pollow fights
<BR>Perfect days for perfect nights
