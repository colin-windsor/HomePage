<P>The favourable properties of tungsten borides for shielding the central High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) 
core of a spherical tokamak fusion power plant are modelled using the MCNP code. The objectives are to 
minimize the power deposition into the cooled HTS core, and to keep HTS radiation damage to acceptable 
levels by limiting the neutron and gamma fluxes. The shield materials compared are W<SUB>2</SUB>B, WB, W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> and WB<SUB>4</SUB> along with a reactively sintered boride B<SUB>0.329</SUB>C<SUB>0.074</SUB>Cr<SUB>0.024</SUB>Fe<SUB>0.274</SUB>W<SUB>0.299</SUB>, monolithic W and WC. Five shield thicknesses between 253 and 670 mm were considered, corresponding to plasma major radii between 1400 and 
2200 mm. W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> gave the most favourable results with a factor of ~10 or greater reduction in neutron flux and gamma energy deposition as compared to monolithic W. These results are compared with layered water-cooled shields, giving the result that the monolithic shields, with moderating boron, gave comparable neutron flux and 
power deposition, and (in the case of W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB>) even better performance. Good performance without water-coolant has advantages from a reactor safety perspective due to the risks associated with radio-activation of oxygen.  <SUP>10</SUP>B  
isotope concentrations between 0 and 100% are considered for the boride shields. The naturally occurring 20% 
fraction gave much lower energy depositions than the 0% fraction, but the improvement largely saturated 
beyond 40%. Thermophysical properties of the candidate materials are discussed, in particular the thermal 
strain. To our knowledge, the performance of W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> is unrivalled by other monolithic shielding materials. This is partly as its trigonal crystal structure gives it higher atomic density compared with other borides. It is also suggested that its high performance depends on it having just high enough  <SUP>10</SUP> B content to maintain a constant neutron energy spectrum across the shield.

<P>Spherical tokamaks present a unique opportunity to accelerate the delivery of safe, carbon-free, abundant, base-
load fusion power [1,2].  They have the plasma closer to the current-carrying central column and so make more 
efficient use of the magnetic field, which decreases with distance from the column. Combining spherical 
tokamaks with the high field capabilities of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) offers a potential route to 
a smaller power plant [3]. The low aspect ratio of the spherical tokamak presents a difficulty: for an HTS core of 
radius <I>R<SUB>core</SUB></I> necessary to provide the magnetic field, the shield thickness available for a plasma of major radius 
<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>, aspect ratio <I>A</I> and a vacuum gap <I>g</I> between plasma and shield is      <I>R<SUB>0</SUB>(A&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)/A&nbsp;-&nbsp;R<SUB>core</SUB>&nbsp;-&nbsp;g</I>.  The lower the aspect 
ratio and major radius, the thinner the space available for a shield. Several studies of candidate shielding 
materials [4-9] have been made using the Monte Carlo modelling code MCNP [10]. It has been shown that the 
inclusion of boron within a tungsten-based shield is advantageous, with its high neutron absorption cross section 
at lower energies [5]. Various practical efforts to fabricate and test the properties of such materials have begun 
[11-14] but the search is on to find the optimal boron-containing material, and optimal parameters for a tokamak 
shield of specified lifetime.
 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The precise constraints that any shield must satisfy are not yet known. The total power deposition determines 
the costs of the cryogenic plant needed to keep the HTS at operating temperatures of say 20 K. Calculations 
suggest that it would be a relatively low fraction of the cost of a 200 MW fusion power plant [4]. More difficult 
to calculate are the radiation damage constraints. Experimental measurements from HTS tapes irradiated in 
fission reactors [15] suggest a limit of order 2x10<SUP>18</SUP>   cm<SUP>-2</SUP> , but the energy spectrum of the flux from such reactors 
is different from that behind a tokamak shield, the temperatures are several hundred K higher, and the damage 
rates much faster. The present work focuses on the properties of tungsten borides as shield materials. Section 2 
indicates why they have advantages. Section 3 details the MCNP methods used and the parameters calculated. 
Section 4 compares the results for monolithic, homogeneous materials. Monolithic shields without cooling are 
appropriate to fusion shots short enough for the shield and core to heat up adiabatically within permitted 
temperature ranges.  Section 5  presents practical considerations arising from the shields, including when water 
cooling is introduced, the effect of varying the proportion of the favourable boron 10 isotope and some 
thermophysical properties of the materials. Considerations of the activation of the materials, their decay after 
shutdown, loss of <SUP>10</SUP>B isotope and radiation damage, all using the FISPACT code, are the subject of further work 
to be submitted shortly. Detailed computations of the heat generated within the shield and the resulting shield 
temperatures are planned in further studies.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>2. The advantages of tungsten and boron as shield materials</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The utility of tungsten and boron as shield materials arises from their favourable neutrons cross sections as 
illustrated in figure 1. Tungsten has several stable isotopes: 30.64% <SUP>184</SUP>W, 28.43% <SUP>186</SUP>W, 26.50% <SUP>182</SUP>W, 14.31% 
<SUP>183</SUP>W and 0.12%<SUP>180</SUP>W. They have similar nuclear properties and figure 1 shows the neutron cross section for 
natural tungsten. The tungsten cross section is dominated by elastic scattering, but between 10 and 20 MeV 
there is an appreciable (n,2n) cross section.  Between 1 and 8 MeV the inelastic (n,n<span style='font-family:Symbol'>g</span>), cross section is 
appreciable, absorbing much of the neutron energy but with the emission of gamma rays. At lower energies, 
from a few eV to 1 MeV, the tungsten isotopes have many resonances for elastic and (n,<span style='font-family:Symbol'>g</span>) reactions. The 
occurrence of the resonance peaks at differing energies for each isotope contributes to the effectiveness of 
natural tungsten as a neutron shield.

<P><B> Figure 1.</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3> The neutron cross sections for tungsten (left) and for boron (right). For tungsten the total (black), elastic (green, 
dashed), inelastic (red, dash-dot), (n,2n) (blue, dotted) and (n,&gamma;) (yellow) cross sections are shown. For boron the minority (20%)  <SUP>10</SUP>B isotope (black) and the majority <SUP>11</SUP>B isotope cross section (blue dashed) are shown. Below 10 keV the  <SUP>10</SUP>B cross section follows an inverse velocity increase with decreasing neutron energy as show in the curve labelled  <SUP>10</SUP>B<SUB>abs,/SUB>. The cross sections are from the Brookhaven National Nuclear Data Centre [16].</FONT>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Boron has two stable isotopes of which the  <SUP>10</SUP>B isotope, with a 20% natural abundance, has the higher neutron 
absorption coefficient, particularly below 10 keV, as illustrated to the right of figure 1. The  <SUP>10</SUP>B neutron capture 
gives rise to a <SUP>4</SUP>He alpha particle, a <SUP>7</SUP>Li atom and a 0.478 MeV gamma ray. This transmutation means that the  <SUP>10</SUP>B 
will be gradually depleted during operations, as will be reported in a later paper. The sub-MeV gamma ray 
produced has the potentially deleterious consequences of contributing to the power deposition in the HTS core, 
causing radiation damage to the shield and core, and generally adding to the radiation dose levels produced by 
the tokamak during operations.  There will also be changes in the thermal, mechanical, and corrosion 
performance in the shield resulting from the transmutation. Isotopically concentrated  <SUP>10</SUP>B is widely used in the 
nuclear fission industry for neutron-absorbing control rods.  For this reason, this study compares the shield 
performance of natural 20% abundance with shields made from 0, 40, 60, 80 and 100% isotopically enhanced 
fractions of  <SUP>10</SUP>B.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The properties of tungsten and boron detailed above provide the key to their use in a fusion reactor neutron 
shield, which must reduce the transmitted power to acceptable levels and limit radiation damage. The plasma-
facing side of the shield faces a flux of energetic 14.1 MeV neutrons from the deuterium-tritium reaction          
<SUP>2</SUP>D + <SUP>3</SUP>T =  <SUP>4</SUP> He + n +17.6 MeV. The 3.5 MeV   <SUP>4</SUP>He  particles are not a problem as their charge keeps most of them 
within the plasma. The shield can reduce the power transmitted by several methods, which are illustrated in 
figure S1 in the supplementary material. 

<P>(i)	Elastic scattering allows many neutrons to be simply reflected back into the fusion chamber. 
Tungsten atoms make a good reflector because of their high mass compared to a neutron ensures 
little recoil energy and ~3 barns of elastic cross section per atom at 14 MeV.  The fluxes reported 
in this paper include neutrons propagating in all directions. Studies including the directional nature 
of the fluxes differentiating inward and outward fluxes are in progress.

<P>(ii)	When incident neutrons collide with lighter atoms, like boron, the collisions exchange, or 
moderate, the neutron energy so reducing the transmitted power. The best moderator is hydrogen 
since its mass is almost the same as the neutron and the maximum energy is lost on collision. It is 
for this reason that water is often used within a shield, where it can also provide cooling, although 
its oxygen activation may give a problem. Boron or carbon with masses around 10 to 12 provide 
intermediate moderation.

<P>(iii)	Inelastic (n,2n) reactions produce a different isotope of the same element.  A typical reaction 
would be  <SUP>183</SUP> W + n =  <SUP>182</SUP> W + 2n + &gamma;, which is highly beneficial transforming each high energy 
neutron into two lower-energy neutrons of a few MeV which are easier to shield.

<P>(iv)	Inelastic (n,n&gamma;) neutron scattering means that the incident neutron forms a new compound nucleus 
which quickly decays to release the neutron with an appreciably lower energy and with the 
emission of the excess energy in the form of a gamma ray. The neutron energy is reduced by 
around 1 to 7 MeV, but this energy is released as a gamma ray of comparable energy. The 
transmitted neutron energy is therefore appreciably reduced but there will be a new gamma flux 
leading to its own transmitted energy and needing extra gamma shielding.

<P>(v)	(n,&gamma;) capture is common at lower neutron energies. The neutron is absorbed to form a tungsten 
isotope with one higher atomic weight with the emission of a gamma ray of significant energy,

<P>(vi)	The lower energy neutrons produced by moderation or inelastic scattering become increasingly 
likely to be absorbed by isotopes such as  <SUP>10</SUP>B with a high neutron absorption cross section which 
normally increases with decreasing energy as 1/v where v is the neutron velocity,  as illustrated in 
figure 1. The neutron transmitted power is reduced but the absorption produces a gamma ray 
leading to increased transmitted gamma power. 
   
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gamma rays are shielded by scattering from electrons in the shield atoms, and thus need high atomic number 
(number of electrons per atom) and high density (atoms/m<SUP>3</SUP>). Tungsten is therefore a comparatively good 
element for a gamma shield, while boron is not.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Table 1 shows the shielding materials selected for this study. Monolithic tungsten and tungsten carbide are 
well known shield materials and are included for comparison. Also included is a reactively sintered iron-
tungsten borocarbide B<SUB>0.329</SUB>C<SUB>0.074</SUB>Cr<SUB>0.024</SUB>Fe<SUB>0.274</SUB>W<SUB>0.299</SUB> [8], hereafter referred to as the borocarbide. The other 
materials have been ordered according to their boron atomic fraction. The assumed densities for natural boron-
containing materials (20%  <SUP>10</SUP>B isotopic ratio), shown in heavy type, were taken from the literature [11]. The values in the table for other isotopic concentrations have been calculated from the 20% values.  To correspond 
to the densities used in this paper they have been multiplied by 0.98 to allow for extra porosity during bulk 
manufacture. Since this and other work shows that the shield performance is very sensitive to material densities, 
the densities of tungsten borides were compared with X-ray powder diffraction measurements found in [17] 
using samples with the natural 20%  <SUP>10</SUP>B isotopic ratio. It is seen that the assumed densities agree with the X-ray calculated values to within three significant decimals except for WB<SUB>4</SUB> where the assumed value is only 82.5% of the X-ray value. It has been shown that this difference is not sufficient to make any material change to the conclusions of this paper. 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In most previous studies the shield design has included annular water cooling channels [4-6]. Water cooling 
presents an operational challenge because of the neutron activation reaction <SUP>16</SUP>O(n,p)<SUP>16</SUP>N; this nitrogen isotope 
decays with a half-life of 7.13 s emitting a 6.129 MeV gamma ray. Besides providing cooling, the hydrogen in 
the water is also an excellent neutron moderator, and this may be a key feature of its success as a shield material. 
This study attempts to address this point by directly comparing monolithic shields with water-moderated 
versions containing 5 radial layers of water distributed over 25 radial layers of shield.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The attenuating effectiveness of a shield depends on its constituent atomic densities. Here the tungsten density 
is key to gamma attenuation, the  boride (or carbide) to neutron moderation, and the boride to neutron 
absorption.  Figure 2 shows these atomic densities for tungsten and for boron or carbon, along with their sum 
plotted against boron (or carbon) density.  W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> is seen to lie above the trend line in all cases and to give the highest total atomic density.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To reduce core power deposition and shield and core irradiation, the main option available is to increase the 
shield thickness, and consequently the tokamak major radius. In this study some 5 plasma major radii have been 
chosen, spaced from 1400 to 2200 mm. The superconducting core has been kept constant at 250.9 mm radius. 
This is consistent with the plasma properties, however in practice it is likely that engineering considerations 
such as the hoop stress at the top and bottom of the toroidal field coils will determine a modest increase in core 
size. The shield thickness is adjusted to keep the plasma gap between the inner plasma boundary and the first 
wall constant. This gave 5 shield thicknesses between 253 and 670 mm.  
   
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarize the shield materials options of this study, some 7 materials, the 5 boron containing materials 
each with 6 isotopic concentrations, both with and without water cooling, and with 5 major radii, are considered 
giving (5x6+2)x5x2=320 shield models. Figure 3 illustrates the radial build of the largest and smallest models.

<P>Neutron and photon transport calculations were performed using the code MCNP 6.2.0 [10] invoking the 
FENDL 3.0 (neutron), MCPLIB84 (photon), and ENDF7U (photo-neutron) cross-section libraries. Calculations 
were performed in a series of steps:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Firstly, weight windows were generated iteratively for each of the models using the automated weight 
window generator (WWG) in MCNP using a tally optimized for reducing the variance of low and epithermal 
energy neutrons and secondary gamma photons in the centre of the core.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Secondly, heat deposition tallies (type F6) were scored within the HTS core for both neutrons and photons 
using the weight windows generated in the first stage calculation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Thirdly, neutron-only transport models were run (in MODE N) with energy-resolved neutron flux tallies (type 
F4) using the CCFE-709 energy group scheme and the variance reduction from stage one turned on; the flux 
tallies were recorded within the HTS core and as a function of shielding depth. In this case, the contribution of 
photo-neutrons to the neutron flux tallies were assessed for certain cases and deemed insignificant.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The energy depositions and fluxes were computed for a nominal 200 MW fusion power plant. The fusion 
neutron creation matrix as a function of radius and height was provided for the 1400 mm major radius case from 
the Tokamak Energy System Code as a matrix of 68 radial segments and 200 vertical segments. Finally, the 
neutron flux files were input to the activation and transmutation code FISPACT, where dpa, gas rate and 
 <SUP>10</SUP>B(n,?)7Li depletion were tracked over a continuous 30-year irradiation period. The results of the FISPACT 
analysis will be presented in a future publication.
  
<P> Most of the results presented will correspond to tallies covering the integral over all energies of the full 
distributions. In particular they are calculated for the following tallies:
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	HTS peak neutron fluence at the vertical mid-plane section within +/- 200 mm of the vertical shield 
centre in  cm<SUP>-2</SUP> MWh<SUP>-1</SUP>units and its error
<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	HTS mean neutron fluence in  cm<SUP>-2</SUP> MWh<SUP>-1</SUP> units and its error
<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Total power in HTS  in kW and its error
<P>4-29.	Neutron fluence  for the 26 surface layers of the shield ( cm<SUP>-2</SUP> MWh<SUP>-1</SUP>) and error
<P>30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Neutron power in the HTS in kW with error
<P>31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Photon power deposition in the HTS in kW with error.
The table of these 31 parameters for all the 320 calculations is given in the supplementary data. Computations 
for the single case of natural W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> at major radius 2200 mm were performed with much improved statistics.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>4. Comparison of monolithic boride material shields</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The neutron and gamma power deposition into shields of the monolithic materials with natural boron isotopic 
concentration, integrated over particle energy, are shown for the monolithic materials at major radii <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> =1400 to 
2200 mm in figure 4. It is seen that the gamma power deposition exceeds the neutron deposition by around an 
order of magnitude. This is despite the fact that the radiation incident on the first wall comprises mainly 14.1 
MeV fusion neutrons with only around 15% proportion of gammas as shown in figure 4 of reference [6]. 
Reference [6] showed that the mean neutron energy dropped steadily through a typical moderated neutron shield 
but that the gamma power remained high, leading to the high gamma power deposition. The graphs in figure 4 
show that the power deposition for both neutrons and gammas generally decreases with boron content up to 
W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB>, where it forms a local trough for all the major radii considered.  The relative change in power deposition 
decreases with increasing device size. For example, at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> =1400 mm W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> shows lower neutron power than W 
by a factor of 6 or so, while at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> =2200 mm this factor falls to ~3. It may be concluded that boron, through its 
combination of neutron moderating and absorption effectiveness, make it the key element in reducing the power 
deposition in these materials. 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The borocarbide B<SUB>0.329</SUB>C<SUB>0.074</SUB>Cr<SUB>0.024</SUB>Fe<SUB>0.274</SUB>W<SUB>0.299</SUB> has good performance at all major radii but is slightly worse 
than the trend of the binary materials. This is probably because of the fraction of chromium and iron which have 
less favourable gamma shielding effectiveness than tungsten.

Statistical errors are shown.  </FONT>

   
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A different presentation of the same data is obtained by plotting the power deposition on a log scale against the 
major radius for each material as shown in figure 5. The neutron power depositions are shown to follow a 
roughly exponential decrease with shield thickness, corresponding to a half-power distance of 42.2 mm, as 
shown by the dot-dashed line, fitted to the monolithic tungsten data. Other materials including W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> show a 
slight upwards curvature suggesting a decreasing performance over W at larger shield thicknesses.  The dashed 
gamma power deposition follows a similar overall decline with shield thickness with the half-power thickness 
for gammas essentially the same as that for neutrons, although there is a gradient change around 400 mm 
thickness.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Another important result is the neutron flux within the HTS core. In this paper the neutron core flux quoted 
will be that at the vertical mid-plane height in the tokamak where the flux is largest, although the mean flux over 
the whole of the core was also calculated and is given in the supplementary data. This peak flux is important in 
determining the lifetime of the HTS core material through its radiation damage. Figure 6 shows the neutron 
fluence within the HTS core for all major radii again as a function of boron concentration. Also included are 
estimations for the maximum possible lifetime for a given HTS material, based on HTS performance 
degradation after neutron fluences of 2x 10<SUP>18</SUP>   cm<SUP>-2</SUP>  [15] at 200 MW fusion power. For example, to enable a 
decade lifetime, the <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>  must be at least 1800 mm, where W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> is the only viable candidate shield material.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The increases in fluence over the 25 tally radii within the shield from the core-side to the plasma-facing side 
are shown in figure 7 for the major radii of 1400 mm and 2200 mm. The fluence is plotted logarithmically for 
each monolithic shield material as labelled. It is seen that the 643 mm thick shield at 2200 mm major radius 
covers some 5 orders of magnitude compared to less than two for the 253 mm thick shield at 1400 mm radius. In 
both cases W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> performs significantly better than the other materials. The order of performance with material 
is slightly changed for the smaller major radius, with the WB and W<SUB>2</SUB.B performing relatively better than WB<SUB>4</SUB> at 
the larger device size. Near the plasma-facing edge all the materials face a similar incident fluence and the 
differences between materials are relatively low.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    All the plots in figure 7 show a similar shape with a gradient build up from the plasma-facing side to a close 
to exponential decrease in the centre of the shield,  A similar but lesser decrease in gradient occurs close to the 
HTS core side of the shield. This behaviour is illustrated by the dashed lines in figure 7 that show an exponential 
decrease in fluence with the half attenuation distances shown. The deviations from the dashed lines are clearly 
seen for <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>  =1400 mm, although for <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>  =2200 mm they are quite small. It is probable that these deviations are 
partly caused by the lack of absorbing boron in the central superconducting core, and at the stainless steel and 
tungsten plasma-facing components as illustrated in figure 3. Although the scales of the plots at the two radii are 
very different, the half attenuation distances of the dashed lines differs only slightly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   For the case of a shield of monolithic W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> at 2200 mm major radius results of higher accuracy were 
available. The top left-hand of figure 8 shows the neutron energy lethargy spectrum as a function of distance 
into the shield for this case.  Lethargy spectra are appropriate when covering the large energy range from 1 keV 
to over 10 MeV. In a lethargy spectrum the quantity plotted per energy bin is multiplied by the bin mean energy 
and divided by the bin width in energy, so that the quantity plotted is dimensionless in energy and sums to the 
total quantity. The spectra have been smoothed by averaging of 3 to 5 energy bins for the energies below 0.02 
MeV and for distances into the shield above 500 mm. 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   A striking characteristic of the top left-hand side of figure 8 is that, with the exception of the red plasma-
facing spectrum, the shapes of the energy spectra up to around 6 MeV are remarkably constant. This feature is 
revealed in the top right-hand side of figure 8, where the intensity has been scaled by the integral of the lethargy 
fluence up to 6.02 MeV. There is a remarkable superposition of the fluence energy spectra from the majority of 
the layers within the shield at energies below 6.02 MeV. The surprising conclusion is that the neutron energy 
spectra below 6 MeV are independent of the depth into the shield!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    While this superposition of the spectra occurs up to 6 MeV, at higher energies the situation is quite different. 
The detail of the scaled lethargy fluence at energies above 6 MeV is revealed in the lower half of the figure 
which shows the same scaled fluence between energies of 1.5 and 15 MeV (bottom left) and between 12.3 and 
14.1 MeV (bottom right). The data in this region can be approximated by the exponential decay given by the 
dashed line described by <I>log<SUB>10</SUB> [F(E)/F(6.02)]= - 1.9log<SUB>10</SUB> [E/6.02]</I> where <I>F(E</I>) is the fluence at energy <I>E</I> MeV.  
     
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The strong superposition of scaled fluences below 6.02 MeV, and lack of superposition above this energy 
suggests quite distinct origins for the flux distributions above and below the black dashed &quot;dividing line&quot; shown 
in the lower left figure. It is suggested that the fluence below this dividing line is caused by &quot;inelastic&quot; scattering 
processes such as the (n,2n) and (n,n&gamma; ) cross sections described in section 2 which reduce neutrons of energy 
around 14 MeV to a broad inelastic spectrum of neutron energies centred around 0.2 MeV and remarkably 
constant at all distances into the shield. In contrast the bottom right plot in figure 8 shows that there is little 
superposition above 6.02 MeV and above the dividing line. This &quot;elastic&quot; fluence is composed of  the original 
14.2 MeV fusion neutrons which may have lost energy principally by elastic scattering from the tungsten and 
boron atoms as they pass through the shield as detailed in section 2. With each increment into the shield, the 
14.1 MeV scaled fluence decreases. At distances into the shield above 300 mm, a peak in the scaled fluence 
appears below 14.1 MeV and shifts to ever lower energies.

The dashed line is used to divide the total fluence spectrum into 'elastic' and 'inelastic' energy spectra above 6.02 MeV. Bottom right (red outline) shows the broadening of the elastic scattering component near 14 MeV.</FONT>
 
    
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Making this assumption, it is straightforward to sum the elastic and inelastic components of the original 
unscaled fluence at each distance into the shield as shown in figure 9.  It is seen that both components start with 
a similar fluence, and both decay approximately exponentially with distance into the shield as shown by the 
dashed lines, with the corresponding half-distance lengths shown. The elastic component is closest to 
exponential with a half-attenuation distance of 33 mm. The inelastic component has lesser decay rates near both 
plasma-facing and core-facing sides as was noted for the total fluences through the shield in figure 7 again 
reflecting the relative lack of absorbing boron material at these points. The result is that the ratio of the elastic to 
the inelastic fluence decreases with distance into the shield from about 1 at the plasma-facing side to 5 at the 
core-facing side. The elastic component has a slowly decreasing mean energy from 14.0 MeV at the plasma-
facing side to 12.8 MeV at the HTS-facing side. The inelastic component mean energy slowly decreases from 
0.8 MeV at the plasma-facing side to 0.7 MeV at the HTS-facing side.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The scaled superposition method worked well for W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> at other radii, and for WB<SUB>4</SUB>, but not for other shield 
materials. Figure 10 shows the unscaled neutron fluence energy spectra for tungsten and tungsten boride 
materials with increasing boron content. The loss of superposition is seen by changes in the energy spectrum 
profile and decreases inversely as the boron concentration. Superposition works well in the range 1 to 6 MeV 
just to the left of the minima in the spectra, but then fails increasing badly as the energy decreases. There are 
much greater fluences at the core-side of the shield than would have been expected from superposition, as 
indicated by the violet circles in the figure.

<P>The similarly-shaped neutron lethargy spectra through the shield observed for the boron concentration of W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> 
suggests a rationale for its exceptional performance. As the depth into the shield increases, an ever-decreasing 
quantity of the broad 'inelastic' neutron spectrum will be added in proportion to the remaining 'elastic' fluence of  
around 14 MeV fusion neutrons. At the same time the spectrum will be softened to lower energies by 
moderation. For the total spectrum profile to be maintained, the  <SUP>10</SUP>B isotope absorption must be sufficient to remove the lower energy neutrons so produced.  In contrast, with for example a W<SUB>2</SUB>B shield, the  <SUP>10</SUP>B absorption 
is insufficient for this, and the neutron spectrum at lower energies builds up continuously with distance into the 
shield as suggested by figure 10 leading to an overall larger power deposition.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The energy spectra per unit lethargy of the deposited power into the superconducting core for the monolithic 
materials are shown in figure 11 for major radii of 1400 mm (left) and 2200 mm (right). It is striking that the 
gamma fluence is ~100 higher than the neutron fluence above 0.1 MeV but drops rapidly below 50  keV as its 
attenuation rapidly increases. Most of the power deposition into the core is within the 0.1 to 10 MeV range for 
both gammas and neutrons. The order of materials is maintained over most of the energy range, for both radii, 
and for both neutrons and gammas. Comparison between the attenuations at the two major radii show a factor of 
~100 for gammas above 1 MeV, but a larger ~1000 factor for neutrons which is roughly maintained over the 
whole energy range. An exception is the energy range 1-14 MeV where WB<SUB>4</SUB> has the highest power deposition. 
The atomic fraction of boron could be critical in this energy range where figure 1 shows the boron cross section 
to be low.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>5. Practical considerations of proposed shielding materials</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       
   

<P>An important practical consideration in any fusion power plant is how to cool the shield. A possible solution is 
to use layers of water for both cooling and moderation. For each of the chosen shield materials, and for each 
boron concentration, the effects of introducing a water moderator were evaluated. The thickness of the water 
layers varied from 10 mm at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>  =1400 mm to 17 mm at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>  =2200 mm. Pure water has been previously chosen as 
a moderator [4-6] but because of its activation problem it may be desirable to avoid it, for example by using 
channels of gaseous helium. A fixed geometry for the water layers has been used with 5 radii spaced through the 
shield as was indicated in figure 3.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Figure 12 shows the neutron and gamma power depositions into the HTS core, with and without water layers 
within the shield materials for major radii of 1400 mm (left) and 2200 mm (right). The presence of water layers 
tends to flatten out the variation of deposited power with boron fraction with decreases at high depositions and 
increases at low depositions. For tungsten and WC, the reduction is considerable. W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> maintains its optimal 
position with the lowest deposited power at all major radii, and with this material, there is always a detrimental 
effect from the addition of water layers. In the larger radius device, the detrimental effect of water extends to all 
of the pure tungsten boride materials. 
.


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Another factor suggested previously [5] was that the tungsten carbide and water shield could be much 
improved by just a single layer of borated material placed on the inside HTS facing layer of the shield where the 
neutron energies are lower, and neutron absorption stronger. To check this, calculations were performed to find 
the HTS power deposition with iron-tungsten borocarbide B<SUB>0.329</SUB>C<SUB>0.074</SUB>Cr<SUB>0.024</SUB>Fe<SUB>0.274</SUB>W<SUB>0.299</SUB> placed in this position 
within a WC and water layered shield. The results are shown in table 2 which confirms the appreciable 
reduction of the borated inner layer shield  compared with the WC and water shield. The W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> shields with and 
without water continue to have superior power depositions.
       
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Table 2 also contains data for the 304B stainless steel shield material which contains around 1.1 atomic 
percent of boron and a density of 7.8 Mg/m3. It is well characterized, readily available and widely used in the 
nuclear industry. It is seen from the last row that both monolithic W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> and W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB>+H2O are more than an order 
of magnitude more effective at reducing core heating for that particular design point than the 304B+H2O. The 
neutron fluence half-attenuation distance through the shield is around 54 mm compared to the 35.5 mm of 
monolithic W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB>.

<P><IMG SRC="WBPaper1Table2.jpg">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   A second practical consideration is whether it could be cost effective to increase the atomic concentration of 
the absorbing isotope  <SUP>10</SUP>B. The results so far have been for the 20% atomic concentration of the absorbing 
isotope  <SUP>10</SUP>B in natural boron. It is possible to create shield materials with an enhanced concentration of  <SUP>10</SUP>B [20]. 
This comes with additional cost [21,22], although this could be considerably mitigated if only say 40% 
enrichment was required.  Figure 13 shows the neutron fluence across W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> shields as a function of the fraction  <I>f</I>  of  <SUP>10</SUP>B in the shield without and with water content for major radius 1400 mm. It is seen that the fluence decreases considerably with increasing  <SUP>10</SUP>B isotopic concentration. Much of the possible gain is achieved by 40% isotopic fraction with higher concentrations having a more marginal effect. The water moderation appears to increase the neutron fluence at all radii except in the case of zero  <SUP>10</SUP>B isotopic concentration. The positions of the water layers are shown by vertical blue lines along the radius axis, and some effects are reflected in the corresponding fluence. The effects of increasing the  <SUP>10</SUP>B isotopic concentration seems to be greater for the monolithic shield than for the water moderated shield.

<P>   A further practical problem arises from the thermophysical properties of the candidate materials as shown in 
Table 3.  The molar heat capacity at room-temperature, <I>C<SUB>m</SUB></I> is taken from Refs [23-25]. <I>C<SUB>m</SUB> </I> of WB<SUB>x</SUB> compounds decreases with increasing boron content. The values of <I>C<SUB>m</SUB></I> are converted into the volumetric heat capacity <I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I> 
using:
<P> <I>C<SUB>vol</SUB> = C<SUB>m</SUB>.&rho;.n/M</I>

<P>where &rho; is the density, <I>M</I>  is the molar mass and <I>n</I> is the number of atoms in the formula unit. The &rho; of the W-B 
compounds showed notable variation in the literature. For example, as shown in table 1 the &rho; of WB<SUB>4</SUB> is given as 
8.4 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> by [11] and 10.2 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> by [16], which could be due to variations in sample porosity. To avoid such 
variability, the values for the borides are selected from only one source reference [11], for consistency. <I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I> 
generally shows the opposing trend to <I>C<SUB>m</SUB></I> with respect to boron content (with the exception of WB<SUB>4</SUB>) i.e. W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> 
has the highest <I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I> of any of the candidate materials. This result is likely due to the higher atomic packing 
density in W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> compared to monolithic W as shown in Figure 2. 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I>, the heat capacity, can be related to the anticipated thermal strains by defining a simple figure of merit, the 
expansion per unit energy, <I>&alpha;<SUB>v</SUB></I>/<I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I> which describes the amount of volumetric expansion per unit of thermal 
energy absorbed.  <I>&alpha;<SUB>v</SUB></I> is taken from refs [17,10,23]. NB: this figure of merit neglects heat exchange with the 
environment, which was necessary as thermal conductivity data are not available for the tungsten borides.

<FONT FACE="Arial" Size=4><P><B>Table 3.</B></FONT> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>Molar Heat Capacity <I>C<SUB>m</SUB></I>, Molar Mass <I>M</I>, Theoretical density &rho;, Volumetric Heat Capacity <I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I>, Volumetric Thermal Expansivity <I>&alpha;<SUB>v</SUB></I>/<I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I> and Expansion per Unit Energy <I>&alpha;<SUB>v</SUB></I>/<I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I>.</FONT>
<P><IMG SRC="WBPaper1Table3.jpg">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Despite W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> having the largest <I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I>, which tends to decrease <I>&alpha;<SUB>v</SUB></I>/<I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I>, this is more than offset by its large <I>&alpha;<SUB>v</SUB></I>. 
Thus, the value of <I>&alpha;<SUB>v</SUB></I>/<I>C<SUB>vol</SUB></I> is greatest for W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB>. This means it will undergo the highest amount of thermal 
expansion for every joule of thermal energy absorbed, while pure W will undergo the least expansion. This 
suggests that thermal strain in W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> may be significantly higher than in W, which may lead to higher thermal 
stresses.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The high thermal strain of W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> is exacerbated by its very impressive power absorption capability, as shown 
in the MCNP calculations. Thus, the expansion for a given neutron fluence is expected to be even more stark 
than the comparisons shown in table 3, suggesting that that the thermal stresses in a W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> shield will be 
significantly higher than with monolithic W. This underlines the importance of assessing the thermal stress 
resistance of candidate tungsten boride shields in future work.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Perhaps the most important practical consideration is the manufacturing capability to produce the tonnes of 
shielding material needed for a fusion reactor. W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> is available in research quantities from several suppliers, 
but not yet for tonnage quantities. 

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>6. Conclusions</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       
<P>Figure 14 graphically summarises the results of  <SUP>10</SUP>B enrichment and boron content with a 3-dimensional surface 
of gamma power deposition as a function of both parameters. The plot illustrates the local minimum power 
deposition for W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB>, shown previously in Figures 4, 6 and 12, is maintained at all  <SUP>10</SUP>B enrichment levels. It also 
shows that the optimal material, i.e. W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> with 60%  <SUP>10</SUP>B or more, shows a factor of ~20 lower gamma power deposition compared to monolithic W.

The gamma power deposition into the HTS core for the monolithic material shields at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> =1400 mm, as

shown with natural boron 20% isotopic concentration.</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      It was previously thought that a hydrogenous moderating material, such as water or a metallic hydride, was 
an essential part of any tokamak shield, reducing the power deposition and neutron and gamma fluences. This 
paper shows that an alternative shield employing light atoms such as boron (Z=5) or carbon (Z=6) can be 
equally as effective, and in the case W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB>, even more so. Boron introduces a third factor, neutron absorption, as 
its absorption cross section rises with decreasing neutron energy. 
     
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   This paper shows that increasing the shield’s boron content generally decreases the power deposition to a 
factor of 10-20 below that of monolithic tungsten, depending on the  <SUP>10</SUP>B content, suggesting that increasing 
neutron moderation and absorption within the shield is a key factor. The trend then reverses between W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> and 
WB<SUB>4</SUB> deposition, probably because of the low density of WB<SUB>4</SUB>  and its relative lack of gamma attenuating 
tungsten. Our study also shows that a monolithic W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> shield far outperforms previously-considered shield 
architectures composed of outer WC layers and inner borocarbide layers [5].

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Energy spectra of the neutron fluence through a W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB> shield at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> =2200 mm suggest that, with this boron 
fraction, the energy spectrum of inelastically scattered neutrons is almost independent of distance into the shield 
and attenuates through the shield at much the same rate as the elastically scattered fusion neutrons. 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The conclusion is that W<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUB>5</SUB>  provides an optimal tokamak shield with its good compromise between gamma 
shielding, neutron moderation and neutron absorption. At the same time, this study also highlights that the 
candidates with the best shielding capability are also susceptible to the highest thermal strains. Further 
understanding of their thermal and mechanical properties, and their evolution under radiation damage, is 
therefore needed. The activation results for the same shield materials and configuration made using the 
FISPACT code using neutron fluxes from this study will be presented in subsequent work.
