<P>This project started with a delightful barbeque with our French neighbour. Their BBQ was new and heavy but needed charcoal and proved difficult to light! The July midday sunshine was really hot! Could we use that? I looked up solar BBQs on the web, but they were expensive or had poor solar concentration. Could one be made from a linear parabolic mirror of cheap aluminium foil. This would give a "line" focus, parallel to the sun's movement, matched to a rectaangular cooking container say 60mm wide and 200mm long. The line focussing need not be too accurate and was constucted from the large quantity of 40mm wide pieces I had recovered from our
Church springclean.

<P>The theory was delightfully complicated and kept me happy for hours. There are four key parameters:
<BR>1.  The angle <I>a</I>, say 58<SUP>o</SUP> of the (yellow) sunshine from the horizontal
<BR>2.  The height <I>f</I>, say 500mm of the (red) focus where the food will be cooked 
<BR>3.  The radius <I>r</I>, say 877mm (blue) of the  mirror (black)
<BR>4.  The anglular range, eg 0 to 200mm (black), along the horizontal axis covered by the mirror.
<P>
The diagram on the left shows this example case. The yellow lines show the incoming sunshine rays at angle <I>a</I> from the horisontal. The mirror radius <I>r</I> is shown in blue, making an angle 
<I>b = 90<SUP>o</SUP> - a</I> with the vertical. The mirror is the black curve at the bottom.

<P>The angle between the sunshine and the normal to the mirror at the chosen point is <I>90-a-b</I>.
The angle of reflection from the mirror normal must equal the angle of incidence, so this angle is also
<I>90-a-b</I>. The angle of the reflected ray from the vertical is then <I>c=90-a-2*b</I>, allowing the position of the ray on the cooking surface to be calculated.

<P>For best results the middle of the mirror should reflect the sun into the cooking area. The figure 
to the right shows a computation of the focussing achieved with a mirror around 500mm long. The accuracy
of the focussing is more than our needs with a 60mm wide cooking width. Interestingly the focussed heat was
easily felt by your hand. These computations were made with a short python code

<P>With late August UK slightly cloudy  sunshine, the measured temperature of the cooking piece reached 90C, sausages took a long while to cook but an egg was fine.

<P>After use, the stand is easily detached from the mirror and folds up to be stored flat over the mirror.
