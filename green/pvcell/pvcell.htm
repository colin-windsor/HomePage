At our home we use about 5 KWhours per day. The mains price averages at 0.14 &pound;/KWh so it cost us &pound;0.70/day 
or &pound;355 per year. I had been sceptical about PV electrical energy. Using our own prices, our 1.8 KW installation
with 10 panels of total area 12.8 m<Sup>2</SUP> cost &pound;9000 and its estimated yield is 1594 KWh/year. 
The pay-back time comes out at (9000/0.14)/1594 or 40.3 years, hardly worth it. 

<P>However the government has its green targets and energy supply worries and in April 2010 decided to pay home generators a
"feed in" tariff of  0.413 &pound;/KWh. This is three times the normal price, and means that the pay back time is 
similarly reduced to a very reasonable 13.7 years. Putting it another way the income of &pound;1593x0.413 is an 8%
tax-free return on our investment. 

<P>Following good experiences from our friends we went to <A HREF="www.thegreenelecrician.co.uk"> 
The Green Electrician </A> who did an excellent and trouble-free installation for us in just three days finsishing
on 15/6/10.
They even gave us a bottle of champagne for being their 100th customer.

<P>Is has been very trouble free. Indeed sitting there quietly on the roof it is out of site and out of mind.
