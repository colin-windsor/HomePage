<P>Update in March 09
<BR>In March 2009 I found that the days are lengthening, and the old car battery voltage after evening use was rising to 12.2V. 
I now wonder how we shall use all the power in the summer. 
<P>In the loft I found my parents old transistor radio. It is a Bush
transistor radio TR82D from the late fifties, and I remember it well in our old house when I was
still at school 50 years ago. I remembered also that we had seen one in an Edinburgh  museum as an ikon of the
fifties. Looking inside was such an unfamiliar sight today. There were discrete Mullard OX71 transistors, 
just two, and big chunky discrete resistors. The "retro" style radio shape is now available in Argus 
with new  digital radio innerds! It seemed with preserving.
It did not ar first work. The problem was the complicated rotating tone/on/off
switch. I replaced it with a simple toggle on/off switch. It then worked fine but was greedy on big  expensive  9V batteries. 
I measured its current and found that with 250 ohm resistors in series the voltage at the radio was just right.
So I soldered wires onto an old  battery top and wired it into my 12 V bench next to the kitchen.
Of course it has no FM but the Long Wave is clear and bright, and will get French radio too!

<P>A second rather frivelous project was a solar clock. In our lounge we have a most beautiful 
grandfather clock, but it is not always wound up. We have an lovely old French antique clock but it  
tends to give unreliable times even when wound up. 
I remembered the rather beautiful quartz clock that my parents had long ago on their mantlepiece and which 
sat in the loft unused. It was from the London Clock Company with a Japanese movement.
It worked fine off a 1.5V battery but to set it up for 12V was not so trivial. 
The now-so-common quartz movement takes very little current for 1 second then takes
about 0.3 amps for a tiny pulse each second as the hands jerk round. I connected the 12 V though a 100K ohm series resister
but placed a 500 microFarad condenser across the clock to smooth out the current pulses. The large resistor means
that it only takes a milliwatt. The capacitor is probably too large as turning it on, you can see the 
voltage across the clock slowly rising  as the condenser charges up through the resistor. 
It settled nicely at 1.5 V across the clock. It sits on our woofer conveniently hiding the electric sockets.
 It has given perfect time ever since.

<P>But it did not use much current so I bought a 120mm diameter 12V fan from Maplin for those
hot days to come. It cost £7.08. It takes 0.4 amps which has yet to be achieved by my solar panel.
It works very smoothly and gives a nice draught. To stop the air "short-circuiting" around the fan and to hide the
rather ugly plastic works, I encased in a heavy case of 20mm thick Belleme oak, stained dark like the bookcase
on which it stands.
