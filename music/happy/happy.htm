<H1>"Happy is the man": A short antham for five solos and choir</H1>
<P><HR></P><FONT SIZE=4>
<P> This song was written in January 1988 for Goring Church choir. The words are 
from Proverbs 3 13-17 as in the 1980 Alternative Service Book:
<P><I>"Happy is the man who finds wisdom,
<BR>And the man who gets understanding,
<BR>For the gain from it is better that gain from silver
<BR>And its profit better than gold.
<BR>She is more precious than jewels,
<BR>And nothing you can desire can be compared with her.
<BR>Long life is in her right hand;
<BR>In her left hand are riches and honour.
<BR>Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
<BR>And all her paths are peace."</i>
<P> The original soloists were, in order:
<BR> Elizabeth Windsor (treble)
<BR> Colin Windsor (Tenor)
<BR> Diane Smith (Alto)
<BR> Colonel Merry (Bass)
<BR> Mary Seymour (Soprano)
