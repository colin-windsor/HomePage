<P> This song was written during a long train journey to Durham.
<BR>When it was finished I sent a copy and a cassette tape to John Betjeman's house
in London

and was very pleased to receive the reply shown.
<P>In 1984 the song was entered for the Wantage Music Festival in the composition section.
It was very well played by the adjudicator Richard Dearing. His comments were: 

<P><I>I liked the very "English" qulaity of the writing - Vaughan Williams in inflection.
This suited the mood of the words perfectly, and the atmosphere was captured with an
economical use of notes. I wondered if the texture and the regular rhythmic figure of each phrase
could be more varied. A little colouring would assist in the charactisation with a varied character for
each verse. Some of the poetic lines could be conceived more as one breath - with more
reference to the puctuation. A less trophic approach would have suited the text better. </i>
<BR> It was at the time rather badly sung by the entrant, but it won the class.

<P>It was also entered in 1995 for a Magdalen Arts class and managed to win.
On 17/6/95 it was sung by the college choir, and I won an engraved dish.
