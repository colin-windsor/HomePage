<H1>"Love came down at Christmas": A carol for solo and choir</H1>
<P><HR></P><FONT SIZE=4>
<IMG SRC="lovecame.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<P> This song was written around 1990 for Goring Church choir. The words are from Christina 
Rossetti's poem:
<P><I>"Love came down at Christmas
<BR>Love all lovely. love devine.
<BR>Love was born at Christmas,
<BR>Star and angels gave the sign.
<P>Worship we the Godhead,
<BR>Love incarnate, love divine.
<BR>Worship we our Jesus,
<BR>But wherewith for sacred sign?
<P>Love shall be our token,
<BR>Love be yours and love be mine.
<BR>Love to God and all men,
<BR>Love for plea and gift and sign"</i>
