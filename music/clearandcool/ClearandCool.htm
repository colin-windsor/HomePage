<H1>"Clear and Cool": A song for a theatrical production</H1>
<P><HR></P><FONT SIZE=4>
<P> This song was written in October 1991 for a panto production by Goring Players
produced by Mary xx of the Water Babies by Charles Kingsley. 
<P><I>"Clear and cool, clear and cool,
<BR>By laughing shallow and dreamy pool,
<BR>Cool and clear, cool and clear,
<BR>By sining shingle, and foaming weir.

<P>Under the crag where the ousel sings,
<BR>And the ivied wall where the church bells ring
<BR>Undefiled for the undefiled
<BR>Play by me, bathe in me, mother and child</i>"
