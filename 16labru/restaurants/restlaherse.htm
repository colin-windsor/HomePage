<H1>Restaurant La Herse in Belleme Forest</H1><P><HR></P>
<IMG SRC="restherse.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<p>We cycled here on 7/7/05. It is a slightly hilly 20 minutes ride up through the
forest, right at the Carrefour de Rendevous, then left on the the Mortaigne road.
By car it is a 5 minute ride towards Mortaigne on the left. There is easy parking
on the road. 
<P>The restaurant is an old hunting Inn. Inside are old photographs of the Duke's
hunt and hounds taking their refreshments. There is a good choice of dishes on the
set menu for €10. We had a freshly cooked quiche lorraine and an egg mayonnaise.
Both served very fresh and tasty with salad. For main course we both had steak. Mine
was Steak Hache (minced a la hamburger) but freshly done with a mustard sauce and 
most excellent.
Mo's was a Steak (long thin beef slices) and very good. We shared a litre of cider.
<P> The cheeseboard contained a fine spoonable cream cheese mixture with garlic 
which I had never experienced before! 
For desert I had apple tart and Mo banana with chocalate
and custard. Coffee was a bit extra!</P>
