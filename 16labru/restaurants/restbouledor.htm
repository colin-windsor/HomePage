<H1>Restaurant Boule d'Or at Belleme</H1><P><HR></P>
<IMG SRC="restbouledor.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<p>This would be our second nearest restaurent just up the hill to Belleme. 
We visited here on Thursday 14/5/09 after cycling to the Belleme market.
It is situated on the Place de General Leclerc roundabout off Rue d'Alencon and opposite the police station and town park.
<P>The restaurant is quite large with perhaps 30 tables and quite full when we went.
The "Menu de jour" is 10 Euros including starter, main course, dessert and a 1/4 litre of wine. 
For starter Colin had a delicious fish mouse and Mo an egg mayonaise.
For the main course Colin had a very large portion of chicken with chips. Mo had a beef stew with 
salad and chips. For dessert Colin had a gorgeous pear cream dish and Mo prunes in a liquor sauce.
<P>Address: Karine and Patrick, Place de General Leclerc, Belleme, 61130.
