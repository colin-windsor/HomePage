<p>On Friday 23/4/10 our friends Libaro and Virgine and their girls, Hilaria and Kiara, were having their kitchen done up:
indeed our ancient earthware sink was being installed.
On the recommendation of our neighbour Martine, we took the brief car ride to Le Pin  la Garenne,
to visit Le Restaurant Croix d'Or. We chose the weekday lunch menu which gave two superb courses for 9.50 euros. Each dish
was served with style. We had between us fried duck, liver sausage and egg starters. For the main course there
was steak, or salmon, or hamburgers for the children. For pudding, there was apple pie or creme brulee. It was great cooking!
