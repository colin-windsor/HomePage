<p> Its a 90 minute 10km cycle ride to this quality restaurant in the quaint town of Noce. 
We cycled on 26/9/06 on a cool sunny day. We went a rather hilly route up into 
the forest, turning right along the forest ride. Then via St Quen and Corubert, 
and past the Courboyer Chateau. We returned on the straight
road to Belleme, which is quicker, but also hilly! The main D920 road would have
been much flatter, but is quite busy.

<P>The restaurant overlooks the main square and the Church. There was a set menu for 
€14. Mo started with a fine salad and I an enormous slice of "Pate du maison" also with salad.
For the main course we both had a flaky-pastry feullette with gorgeous hot spicey fishy
souce and pasta. There was good cheese on a plate. For pudding we chose home-make
"tarte du pommes". 

<P> For €5 we had a pitcher of white wine.
