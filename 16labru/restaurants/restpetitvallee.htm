<p>This is a most pleasant 30min cycle ride away. We went on 22/6/06 cycling up
into the forest, turning right at the first crossroads, then left along the railway track.
A right turn brought us along a track to the main road between Belleme and Montaigne.
Up the hill and down and it on the right. There is easy parking outside.  

<BR> It is owned by an Algerian lady and Moroccan gentleman. Cuscous is their 
speciality. At lunch time for €10 we had an entree from the sideboard. I had
eggs, ham, pate, and carrots. For the main course Mo chose steak with chips and I
pork and potatoes. In the end we swapped because of Mo's teeth. The steak was so
big we took half home for another meal!

There was a fair choice of puddings. I had a fruit salad and Mo a chocalate mouse.
We had a bottle of cyder to drink.
