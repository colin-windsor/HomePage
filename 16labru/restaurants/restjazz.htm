<p>What a miracle this place is. A tiny hamlet South-East of Montaigne, it
comes alive on Friday nights with live jazz played with panache and gusto.
Opened in 2004 by an Englishman who retired from Southampton University to
start this venture with his violinist wife, who does the cooking.
We went on 8/9/05 with our friends from 1, La Bruyere, Linda and Jean-Pierre.
It is 10km or so from St Martin up the road to Montaigne. Turn right at the sign
for Reveillon 5km before Montaigne. It is right in the centre of the 
village on the square across from the Church.
<P> The menu is Anglo-French. We had the €12 set menu. It was a delicious tuna bake
with fried coughtettes. Then came salad with cheese, and a choice of ice cream.
We had a bottle of Cote du Rhone beteen us for €10.
The band started at 9.00pm and played till midnight. The owner lead on trumpet
with a relaxed disipline, directing from the front with a kind word for every solo.
There was a visiting English saxophonist, and a very brilliant if frenetic
young visiting drummer. Backing was
from a French bass guitarist whose moving basses were played with relaxed skill.
The resaurant became completely full with many sitting on the floor.
