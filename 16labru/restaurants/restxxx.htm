<p>This is on the main "Avenue de Dr Boutron through Belleme, 
opposite the old school. We cycled there on 13/6/06 with our friends Norman and Janet.  

<p> We had the midweek lunch menu for €9.60 which gives a two-course meal. 
Mo and Norman had Avacodo pear with salad for entree. For the main course
we had "Coline" fish beautifully served with a herb source and a delicious egg
souflee, potatoes and salad. Mo had an enormous pork knuckle with mung means. For desert Norman and I
had "Isle flotant", big lumps of boiled merangue floating on home made custard
with real vanilla.

The service was fine. We had a beer but this was extra.
