<p> A touch far for a cycle ride, but 10 minutes in the car, this restaurant is
ideal, as we did, for spending the lunch hour while the shops are shut! 
The restaurant is along
the main road into the town from Belleme on the right just after the first traffic
lights and before the second set. Parking is possible just outside.
We visited on 20/9/05
and had the €10 plat de jour, but there was a wide variety of other menus.
The ambiance was delightful, with nice table linen, and a non-smoking dining room.  
<P> The hor d'oeuves was a soft fish pate with salad and source, very nicely laid
out on the plate.
<P>The main course was a cut of ham, very tasty and even. It was served with
pasta and a soft and buttery pepper source. 
<p>There was a wide choice of desserts but we had a pear tarte, very French, with 
a vanilla custard base and the pears cut very thin and laid out sideways. A sight 
for the eyes as well as the taste.
Then came free coffee!</P>
