<H1>The restaurant at Pervencheres</H1>
<IMG SRC="restpervencheres.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<p> We cycled here on 24/4/7 taking a lovely route through the forest to La
Perriere and then on the D275 with only a short session on the main D931. It took
1 hour 20mins. <P>The restaurant is just opposite the front door of the clean and
lofty church which was open. Our meal was served by the owner Bernadette, and cost €10.50 
for a salad starter, a cold meat dish, main course, cheese, dessert and a choice
of a bottle of wine, cyder or bottled water. 
<P> Our main course was a ball of pork and sausage wrapped into a ball, originally
tied up with string. It was served with a fine mushroom sauce and was delicious.
