<p>We cycled here on my birthday 28/6/05. It is only 9 km or so from St Martin, 
along the nicest empty valley road. Take the first road on the right off the
bypass after the supermarket.
<P>The restaurant in unpretentious but with superb service and fine value. 
On the table was 1.5 litres of bottled water and a full bottle of wine. We had
grated carrot with delicious vinegret source, a vast chicken leg with potatoes and 
mushrooms, a cheeseboard to grace the finest English restaurent, and Normandie tart
of caramelised apples. Then came free coffee!</P>
<P>Address: 38, Rue du Mans,61130 IGE.
