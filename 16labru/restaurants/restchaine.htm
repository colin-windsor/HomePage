<IMG SRC="restchaine.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<p> By car it is only 3 km or so from La Bruyere on the 
main road to Mammers from St Martin past the Champion's supermarket.
It is at the Belleme end of the village on the left.
However infinitely nicer is to cycle through the forest as we did on 30/6/05.
It is twice a long but get you into just the right appetite. 
Go up the forest road from La Bruyere. Take the second road on the left
signposted for La Perriere. Take the first road on the left which leads you
down to Gue de la Chaine.
<P>The restaurent is quite large and when we arrived was nearly full.
For a full 4-course meal with wine it is fine value at €9.50. 
On the table was 1.5 litres of bottled water and a choice of a litre of cider
or a carafe of red, white or Rose wine. 
The hor d'oeuves was splendid! it was laid out on a big table for you to 
help yourselves. We had Rillette, pate, various meat and sausages, beans, 
beetroots, egg salad, cauliflower.
There was a choice of main courses. We had Calve's liver and a selection of 
garden vegetables. From the cheese board we had blue de something, gruyere,
camembert and Brie. Desserts were home made. We had creme anglaise.
Then came free coffee!</P>
