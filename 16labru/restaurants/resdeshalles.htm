<p> This restaurent/bar is on the sunny side of Mammers main square. When eating 
indoors seems a waste of potential sun tan, this is a lovely place to sit outside
and watch the Mammers world go by.

We visited on 20/9/06 and had the €7 special salad dish. It was a large diameter 
plate filled with cod fish, shrimps, boiled egg, lettuce, tomato, carrots, and
artichoke hearts. All with a lovely dressing. Very healthy eating!

We did have to pay €2.60 for 50cl of still water!
