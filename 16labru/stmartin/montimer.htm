<H1>The chateau de Montimer at La Perriere</H1><P><HR></P>
<IMG SRC="montimer.jpg">
<p><p>It is a lovely (7km each way) cycle ride to visit this our local "Chateau". 
It is a private house and you cannot go in. Cycle up into the forest and turn left for
La Perriere. As you descend steeply into the town, turn right at the T junction and it is 
about 100m further on on your left. You can make a circular trip by returning via Bellevilliers.
