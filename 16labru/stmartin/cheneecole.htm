<H1>The great oak of the forest: "Chene de l'ecole"</H1><P><HR></P>

<p><p>It is a delightful (10km each way) cycle ride, or a good days walk, to visit this, the largest
and oldest tree in the forest. I cycled there up through La Bruyere, left at the top
towards La Perriere, down two dips then straight ahead until a crossroads clearly
sign posted. You turn left, down the hill for 400m and then the tree is off the road to the left along a small track. 

<P>A large notice board gives you all the details. It is reputed to be 330 years old and have a height of 40m! 
The easyest way home is much as you came, but a lovely if hilly alternative
is to carry on down the hill, turn left along a track then right down the hill
to the road from Le Perriere to Gue de la Chaine.
