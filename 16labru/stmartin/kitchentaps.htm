<H1>The toilet: if it is noisy</H1>
<P>
<HR>

<P></P><IMG src="" align=right> 
<P>Sometimes the toilet is noisy, and dribbles water into the basin. There is no 
overflow, if the ball valve is not closing properly the wasted water flows down 
into the basin. 
<P>The top knob pulled for flushing unscrews. It may be necessary to use thin 
plyers to held the stem. The knob removed, the 1" diameter plastic nut below it 
can be unscrewed using an adjustable wrench. The float valve slides up and down 
the valve on the left. The washer seems flexible and reliable, but the 
cylindrical float and its mechanism gets chaulked up and fails to move freely. 
The normal water level is very clear from a chaulk rim and if the level is much 
above this some attention is needed. 
<P>Much of the chalk can be removed from the float and mechanism with the 
fingers. If this fails the mechanism can be unscrewed using the large knurled 
nut. A wrench is necessary as if it is not tightly screwed up the mechanism will 
leak! When unscrewed the mechanism can be removed by twisting it about to free 
it from the float. It can then be cleaned or soaked in killrock. To replace, put 
the rubben ring in first with the red post fitted into the indetentaion on the 
mechanism. 
<P>We have placed a plastic bottle in the basin to reduce the flush a little.
