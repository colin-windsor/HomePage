The church is situated at the centre of the village and is usually open. 
When we first came here services were once a month, but now it is only used for funerals,
weddings and concerts.</P>
<P>A short history of the church is available in 
<A href="churchhistoryfrench.htm">French </A>(and <A href="churchhistory.htm">here in English</A>).
