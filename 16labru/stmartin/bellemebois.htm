<H1>The woodyard at St Martin: Belleme Bois</H1><P><HR></P>
<IMG SRC="bellemebois.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<p> Belleme forest is carefully managed and trees of all sizes are felled to keep the forest 
productive and beautiful. Belleme Bois in the centre of St Martin is where the trees are dried,
cut up into planks, and machined into all manner of shapes. Buying is easy from the little shop 
there. There are several qualities for oak (chene). At the cheapest end you can go the
the warehouse and pick your pieces. At the opposite end you can order a kit for a door 
or shutter. Prices for finished oak are are say 60€ for our kitchen shutter.
Dominique is the helpful man in the picture. He can cut a big oak length perfectly.
