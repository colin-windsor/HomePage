<IMG SRC="champions.jpg">
<p>The big Champions supermarket is in St Martin 1km from the house.
It is about 1km and easy to cycle or walk. Go down the road, turn right
to go through the village. It is on the junction between the by-pass 
and the road to Mammers. It opens at 8.00am.
<P>There is also a big "MAG"s Hardware store on the same site.
