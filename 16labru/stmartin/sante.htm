<P>We walked up through the forest and down the old railway track to reach the 
Belleme-Montaigne main road. Cross the road and go up to near the top of the 
second lay-by on the right going towards Montagne. It is only 1km from the house. The course is 
well marked and consists of a 2km walk through the forest interspersed with 13
exercise activities - all nicely made from wood. There are bars to jump over, ramps
to crawl over, gates to climb over, and several lie-down back-stretching excercises.
For the children there is a mountain climb! Its all very good fun for all ages. 

<P> You can walk home along the road to St Martin, or through a lower path through th
forest.
