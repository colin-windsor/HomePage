<H1>Things to do when you arrive at the house</H1><P><HR></P>
<p> The front door is often double locked. After unlocking you must turn the central knob and push hard to open it. It can be quite stiff.

<P>The electrics need to be switched on first. The main switch is inside the house on the outside wall to the right of the front door as you enter, and there is a big red switch which needs to be up for the electrics to be on. A torch is a good idea here.

<P>The water can be turned on next. This is low down in the South-East corner of the house under the TV. There are two taps, avoid the one with an outlet, and only switch on the labelled one that carries on to the house supply.

<P>Next turn on the gas. We do not switch off the outside gas mains tap. There are just two switches in the kitchen to undo. The first is behind the cooker to switch on the stove. The second is the yellow switch on the under-surface of the boiler, which needs to be turned from the cross position to the in-line position.

<P>Turning on the oven is complicated. Get the gas lighter near the kitchen South wall. Turn the oven dial to 8, put the lighter near the gas outlet in the oven, which should light. The depress the dial for around 20 seconds for the safety system to work." 

<P>Next switch on the boiler. There is a mains on/off button at the top-right of the controls. Press this and the display should light up. The central button goes through the three options of "heating only", "hot-water only" and "heating + hot-water". Choose what you need. The two temperatures shown allow you to adjust the hot water temperature (left) and central heating water temperature (right). Output is further controlled by the room thermostat on the kitchen wall to the South side of the steps from the lounge. The temperature scale is a bit low, so choose a temperature a few degrees higher than the one you want.
<P> There is no central heating in the attic, but electric heaters are around in the house.

<P>The water to the bathroom toilet may be off. Simply turn on the little tap near the cistern top. Water may leak into the toilet for a while. There are spare towels on the shelf behind the bath.

<P>There is plenty of bedding available, mostly in the second bedroom cupboard. Pillow are in the green chest in the third bedroom.
