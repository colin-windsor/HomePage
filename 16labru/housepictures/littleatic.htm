<H1>The little attic </H1>
<P><HR></P>
When the new attic was built, we missed our place to store things that did not 
mind a bit of cold and damp. I made a hole in the mezannine bedroom ceiling. There
is a beamed ceiling hidden above. I made a further hole through the straw and earth 
covering and there was our not-so-little attic! It must have been last touched in 
1957 for there was a copy of the Parisiene of that date. You can see its cartoons in the
bedroom below.
