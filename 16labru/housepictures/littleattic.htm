<H1>The fairy lights </H1>
<P>

<P></P>The stairs of the house are pitch black on winter nights. The fairy 
lights are designed make it easy to find your way to the bedroom door and go 
down the stairs to the loo. 
<P>They are "Light Emitting Diodes" which are pin-head sized wafers of Gallium 
Arsenide Phosphide layered onto a Gallium Phosphide base. The electron bands in 
these semiconductors are pulled about by the applied voltage so that "gap" 
between them is just 2.3 electron volts, equivalent to the wavelength of yellow 
light (588nm). 
<P>The power dissipation is very low, 0.04 Watts, so that the 30 lights on the 
stairs take only a total of 1.3 watts, which is quite negligible. There's really 
no need to switch them off! 
<P>They can run on AC power, as the diodes rectify the current natually. I 
happenned to have a 20V AC transformer that nicely runs 11 diodes in series, 
each having an RMS voltage of 1.8V. This corresponds to a peak voltage of about 
3V, not far below the limiting voltage of 3.4V. The reverse voltage can be as 
high as 5V, so there is no problem with the rectification. The important thing 
is to wire up all the diodes with the same polarity. If one is wrong none of 
them will work.
