<H1>The house attic: Grenier</H1>
<P><HR></P>
The attic was built in June 2005 by Serge Dutertre and his three workers: , who 
worked really hard for a month. It cost 18,220 euros. 
Nearly all the old timbers found a use, making two wooden arches for the garden,
and the big "ferme" which held up the roof found a place against the lounge wall.               
The "lucarne" (dormer window) has the most lovely views. We bought the guard rail
from Michelle's yard.
