<p> 1. Passports and European Health cards. If you have these you have to pay for any doctor treatment but can claim it back when you get home. Ensure you have receipts!</p>
<p> 2. Ferry booking code or tickets: ferry times</p>
<p> 3. Key for the La Bruyere front door. Open the door by the big central knob when unlocked</p>
<p> 4. Bank and credit cards and Euro cash. There are cash machines in Belleme (near post office)</p>
<p> 5. Phone and charger, organiser or phone book. There is no line phone</p>
<p> 6. Camera and charger</p> 
<P> 7. There is no wifi in the house. Best is to go to the Marie and ask for the password there. It only has to be done once. Then it works even when the Marie is closed, even from the nice table in the garden.
<p>    We hope you have a happy stay!</p>
