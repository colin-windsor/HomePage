<P><HR></P>
<p> There is no rubbish collection day any more.
Any glass, metal, paper, cardboard and plastic can be taken down to the local dechett. Go down the road to town and turn left. On you right in 50m is the dechett area. General kitchen waste in a black bag can be loaded into 
the separate cylindrical containers, but these require an ID  card left in the kitchen to the right hand side
of the steps.

<p> Larger things should be taken to the "Dechetterie" or tip collection point
marked on the Belleme map. It is manned during the day</p>
<P>If you are driving home via Bellavillier there are convenient collection points just before you approach the juction before the town.
