<H1>Rubbish collection</H1>
<P><HR></P>
<p> There is no household rubbish collection.</p>
<p> Rubbish should be taken to the local dechet
which is only a few hundred metres away.
Go down the road to the cross roads and turn north.
In 50m on your right is the local dechet. There are bins for:
a) All glass things
b) Cardboard, plastic bottles and tins for recycling
c) Bagged household waste. This must be <40 litres
and in a black plastic bag. They are placed in
the round containers. To open these you need the 
special electronic card placed in the kitchen draw to the left of
the steps on the North side.

Larger things should be taken to the "Dechetterie" or tip collection point
marked on the Belleme map. It is manned during the day</p>
<P>If you are driving home via Bellavillier there are convenient collection points just before you approach the juction before the town.
