<H1>Using the oven</H1><P><HR></P>
<IMG SRC="oven.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT"> </p>
<P>The oven is both gas and electric. The gas must be turned on both at the main
near the TV and behind the cooker. The electricity must be plugged in.

<p>The two gas hobs do not reliably light automatically. Use the lighter on the shelf.
This works best if you hold it upright while pressing the switch. The automatic lighter
will work if you are patient and blow the hop while the spark is on.

<p>The two electric rings take a while to heat up and cool down.

<p>The oven only works if:
<BR>(a)The "THERMOSTAT" is turned up
<BR>(b)The "MINUTERIE" timer is set for some minutes
<BR>(c)The "FOUR" is turned to one of its setting- see below

<p> The oven has three separate elements and a rotating spit.
<BR>If the FOUR symbol has a heavy line at the bottom the main oven heater in on
<BR>The inner and outer grill elements are denoted by inner and outer upper symbols
at the top of the FOUR symbol.
<BR>The central double arrow in the symbol indicates a rotating spit.
