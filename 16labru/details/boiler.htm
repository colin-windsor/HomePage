<H1>Lighting the boiler (Problems: D Philaut 02 33 25 49 55)
<BR> The boiler is covered by a service contract 00011585. 
<BR>Simply phone Philaut Gaz if there are problems.</H1><P><HR></P>
<P> The boiler heats the hot water heated directly with no tank. 
The central heating is a closed system with no header tank.
The big <Hot Water - Central heating > knob allows hot water only or both.
There is a themostat to the right of the kitchen steps going up. 
<p> (a) Turn on the gas supply just underneath the boiler</p>
<p> (b) Press the white knob near the bottom right of the  boiler 
and hold for 30 secs. The fan should move and the pilot come alight.</p>
<p> (c) Remove your finger slowly. The boiler should stay alight.  </p>
<p></P>

<p> If this should fail, you can manually light the pilot! </p>


<p>(1) Remove the white front of the boiler by lifting upwards and forwards. </p>
<p>(2) Undo the lower screws on the front plate beneath the circular window.</p>
<p>(3) Insert the 1" thick wooden wedge so that you can get a taper up behind the plate. </p>
<p>(5) Find the 6" taper, or make one from 2 long matches joined with tape</p>
<p>(6) Turn on the elecricity and gas supplies to the boiler and press the white button to the bottom right.
The fan should start wirring and continues while the button is pressed. There may be a draught which can be 
suppressed by temporarily covering the outlet flue outside with a cloth. </p>
<p>(7) Light the taper and insert it up inside the boiler and light the pilot. 
The flame lights just behind the window within the boiler casing.
Continue pressing the white button for around 3 minutes while the pilot light heats up the control system </p>
<p>(8) Slowly remove you finger from the white button. The flame should remain lit. If there is a big click and 
the flame goes out, you mast start again, 
<p> Not easy!</P>
