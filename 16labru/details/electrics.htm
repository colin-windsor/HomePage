<P><B>Plugs coming loose:</B> They are not screwed in to the wall but clamped 
against the socket and are prone to come loose.</P>
<P>When you pull on the plug hold the socket in as you pull</P>
<P>It is fairly easy to correct if they are badly loose</P>
<P>TURN OFF THE MAIN SWITCH BY THE FRONT DOOR</P>
<P>Uncrew quite a long way the clamping screws to the left and right of the 
socket</P>
<P>Check that the two clamps will press against the correct part of the 
socket</P>
<P>Press firmly into place and tighten up the screws</P>
<P>A box of electrical tools is in the cupboard under the lounge window</P>
