<H1>How to get there across the channel</H1>

<P><HR></P>
<P>1. The quickest way is via Portsmouth to Caen via
<A href="http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk">Brittany Ferries</A>,</LI>
The journey to Portmouth is about 70 miles and takes 80mins.
The crossings go at 9.00, 15.15 and 20.00.
The drive via Falaise, Alencon, Sees and Le Mele takes about 2 hours.
There is motorway all the way to Sees but after Junction 11 you have to pay a toll of about 8 Euros</p>
<p>2. A cheaper alternative is from Portsmouth to Le Havre via 
<A href="http://www.ferrysavers.com/">LD Lines</A>, who took over P&O including 
one of their boats and many staff,
This can be much cheaper but there is only one boat each day. It goes at 11.00pm or so 
meaning that a cabin is desirable, but often they are all gone. The journey is only a bit 
longer as there is a new motorway over much of the route. A ticket with cabin is about  130.
<P> 3. Much the cheapest route is to go from Dover to Bolougne with 
<A href="http://www.speedferries.com/Speedferries">Speedferries</A>. It is a fast hydrofoil and only takes
about an hour and costs about &pound35
But you have the tedious journey to Dover and then 4 hours solid motorway to Belleme. We usually
take 8 hours and enjoy ourselves. There are lovely beaches near Bolougne, and many delightful
towns to visit and stop for a good meal. Rouen can be a problem on this journey. We have found 
a delightful country <A href="rouenbypass.htm"> "bypass"</A> that turns this part of the 
journey in a pleasure trip.</P>
