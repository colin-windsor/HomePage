The A28 motorway comes up from Belleme and continues to Calais but stops across Rouen
which can be very busy. This "bypass" takes you to La Bouille, a delightful town along the 
banks of the Seine abounding with artists. Aptly, it is the twin town of Whitchurch.
It has a free ferry (bac), and there is a lovely 
walk along the north bank of the Seine with easy carparking. The route takes you along 
the Seine valley and through the forest of Roumare.
