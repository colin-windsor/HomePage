<p>An easy cycle ride up into the forest and across to the Montagne road soon brings
you to the old Roman spring called "La Herse". 

<P>There is a noticeboard with all the details in French. The spring itself does not look
too clear, but it is reputed to have magical medicinal even aphrodisiac powers.

<p>There is a lovely octagonal wooden house near the spring.
