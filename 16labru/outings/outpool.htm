<H1>The mill pool at Mauves for swimming</H1><P><HR></P>
<IMG SRC="mauvepool.jpg">
<p><p>It is a pleasant (16km each way) cycle ride, or an easy cycle ride to
this pool which is perfect on hot summer days.

Go up into the forest, turn right and left at the road to Montagne. Turn right at
Epparais whose large church door facing the road is often open. Follow the road
towards Mauve. It is just South of the village.

<P>This old mill pool has a nice picnic area next to it and easy parking. That said, 
it is sheltered from the road and very quiet.
There is an almost sandy beach for first getting in. It is a bit stony later on
but nothing too bad. The water is out of your depth in the centre but shelves
only slowly at either end. On a very hot day it is a great way to cool down.
