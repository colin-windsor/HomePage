<H1>The Druid's stone in the forest</H1><P><HR></P>
<IMG SRC="druid.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<p>This is not the most impressive ancient relic, but it is on the route of the nicest of 
cicular cycle rides from our house. Both directions are fine. Clockwise you ride up the hill
into the forest. Turn East at the top of the hill at "Rond de Rendevous". Cross the horrid main road
and carry on gently up hill until the big "Carrefour de sept bras". About 200m further on just 
at the top of the hill, there is a sign on the left saying "Pierre des Druids". Follow the path
into the forest for about 50m and there it is on your left.
<P>To continue the round trip, carry on down the hill until you meet the bigger route D5 from
Mauves to Belleme, where you turn right. A hill takes you down out of the forrest and a slow
uphill takes you past the big Agricultural Cooperative building to the road into Belleme.
