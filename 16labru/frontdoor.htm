<H1>Problems with front door</H1><P><HR></P>
<P>The front door sometimes sticks especially in wet weather. 
Make sure the floor under the door is quite clean and free of tiny stones.
Since the front door of #18 was moved, the door sometimes sticks on the concrete floor.
To correct this raise the door slightly. Find the blue crow bar in the big toolbox and place it under the door.
Raise the door very slightly and insert or adjust the little wire spacer that should be there.
