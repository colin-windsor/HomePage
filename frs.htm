<FONT SIZE=4><P>Dr Windsor is distinguished for his outstanding experimental and 
modeling skills, used to especial effect in the industrial application of beams of neutrons. 
He demonstrated the use of pulsed beams of neutrons to study solid matter, and pioneered 
the application of the penetrating abilities of neutrons to study critical defects and 
internal stress in engineering products. More recently he has applied pattern recognition 
techniques and neural nets to a range of areas, including weld defect classification, 
the analysis of the financial index, and signature recognition.</P>
