<P>The Lion and Albert (with apoligies to Albert!)

<P>Here's a story I really must tell you
<BR>Cos I feel that its right to complain
<BR>It tell of the plight of poor Margaret
<BR>Of a Brain that has gone doen the drain.

<P>There's so much commotion in England
<BR>Over scientists mass immigration
<BR>To lands flowing with milk and with money
<BR>And luxurious experimentation

<P>There's a dump in Newhaven called Bradley's
<BR>Where Margaret was paid to advise
<BR>About making and testing detectors
<BR>To be sold at a fabulous price

<P>A stupid old man, Dr Bradley,
<BR>Though dressed in his best - quite a swell
<BR>He hoped to impress all his clients
<BR>Thereafter dud products to sell
