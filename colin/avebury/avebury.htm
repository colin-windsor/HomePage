<P><B>1. 	The history of Avebury House </B>

<P>The house was built in 1906 by John Eggington, on land bought from the Board of Charity Commissioners. He previously lived in the centre of Goring at xxx house. At that time the house lay in open countryside as in figure 2. He lived there until 1919. There have only been 5 owners since then:

<P>1919	Herbert Puxley, who died in 1937
<BR>1938	Jean and Margaret Anderson
<BR>1947	Frank Whitfield. He ran Avebury Research Labs, and sold  off the Ferne Close land. 
<BR>1966 	Desmond and Barbara Payne. They developed the Coachhouse.
<BR>1970	Colin and Margaret Windsor. The built the garage, and later sold the Coachhouse.

<P><I>Fig 2: A view from Larden Chase showing the house amid fields</I> 

<P>
When the house was built, it was designed with servants in mind. There are 4 main bedrooms accessible from the main landing, and 3 more upper bedrooms accessible by a back stairs. Some of the upper bedrooms studiously avoid a view over the lawn. They lie behind the left and right gables of the West frontage shown in figure 1. The back stairs continues to the kitchen area where there is, besides the kitchen, a butler's pantry, a scullery, a large cold storeroom and an outside toilet. 

<P>There is a clear demarcation of style between the West and South Wings, facing the lawn, and the East and North Wings, facing the coach house yard and road. The West and South elevations contains the lounge, dining room, study, landing and all main bedrooms. The East and North elevations contain the kitchen, bathroom, airing cupboard, servant's landing and some of the servant's bedrooms. Figure 3 shows the demarcation points on the first two floors. On the left is the door from the main hall into the kitchen area. On the right, the door from the main landing into the servant's landing. Many points of style change at these points. The dark oak doors of the main hall change to plain. The panelled doors with brass finger guards of the upper landing change to plain.

<P><B>2.	Development history of Avebury House </B>

<P>
The Ordnance Survey map around 1960 in figure 3 shows that the open spaces around the house survived until this period. The nearest developments were along the Wallingford Road and along Milldown Road. However around 1962 the land to the North of the house around Lycroft Close was sold and developed, as was the land around Lockstile Way to the South and Lockstile Mead to the West. In 1965 Frank Whitfield sold off much of Avebury garden to make the estate of Ferne Close. The development was sensitively done from the point of view of Avebury House, and no other house overlooks the main West elevation of the house. The house and grounds were well used at that time. Avebury Research Laboratories occupied the top floor of the house, the greenhouse and a three outbuildings in the area where the garage was to be built. In 1966 when the Paynes bought the house, they sold to Mr and Mrs Jefferies the part of the front garden, which was to become part of 22, Milldown Road. At the same time the Coachhouse was developed and turned into a dwelling within the grounds of Avebury House. Around 1976, the out-houses which had been part of Avebury Research Laboratories were demolished and a new garage was built. Nothing more in the way of development took place until 2000 when the Coachhouse and garage were sold off together.

<P><B>3.	Can Avebury House survive as it is?</B>

<P>
The house was first put up for sale with Warmingham on 25/5/00 but no private offers were received, only an unsolicited development offer. Later with Dudley Singleton the Coachhouse was sold, but no private offers for the house were received which came within 28% of the best offers received by developers. None of the around 15 private families who came to view the house had enough children to fill the bedrooms, even allowing for a guest room! These factors lead us to accept the developers offer. The house remains too large for the families of those who might afford to buy it. The garden is too large for working parents to keep up. The upper bedrooms, with their potentially lovely views, are mostly dark and remote from the life of the main house. The kitchen area, with its two sculleries, is from another age.  In conclusion, there is no market for the house as it is. If it is desired that the house should stand, it must change.

<P><I>Fig 4: The neighbouring properties around Avebury</I>


<P><B>4.	The potential of the garden</B>

<P>Avebury enjoys a lovely garden shaded by two mature trees, a copper beech and a fir, both with preservation orders. It is set mostly to lawn, with a sloping rockery along the West frontage. It takes a great deal of gardening upkeep! According to the Paynes, who lived in the house from 1966, there had always a full-time gardener employed before then! 

The house, at present with the coachhouse sold, stands in some 1558m<SUP>2</SUP> and has a frontage of about 41m. If one takes the 10 houses opposite in Milldown Avenue and the 7 adjacent properties on the same side, as shown in figure 4,  the average plot area is some 445m<SUP>2</SUP> and the average frontage is some 15.1m. The plots in Ferne Close are appreciably smaller. Avebury house area or "footprint" is some 160m<SUP>2</SUP>, compared to an average of around 86m2 for the surrounding houses. Thus while having around twice the area, it enjoys 3 times the plot size. 

This present imbalance would be reduced if around 30% of the plot area was sold along with 40% of the frontage, to create a new plot which would enjoy approximately the same area and frontage as the neighbouring properties in Milldown Avenue.  

<P><td><img src="house&garden.jpg"></td>
<P><I>Fig 5: A plan of the garden showing the possible division into two plots</I>

<P><B>5.	The best site for a dwelling in the garden</B>

<P>
The site for any new dwelling would need to be such that it did not prejudice the view from the main rooms in the West frontage. This could be achieved if it was in line with #16 Milldown Avenue as seen from the central room. It should also lie outside the overhang of the two large trees, and not overlook the garden of #16 Milldown Avenue, and of course lie within the plot area and frontage specified above. All these objectives could be achieved by a house placed within the plot as shown. This orientation of the new dwelling would balance the existing 12<SUP>o</SUP> orientation of Avebury with respect to the road.

<P>The angled boundary would enable Avebury to enjoy the more distant view to the South West and enable the new dwelling to have enhanced privacy from Avebury windows. Figure 6 shows sketches of a possible new house, seen as a dormered bungalow, as seen from the main house dining room, and from the nearest house with any view of the site,  11 Milldown Avenue. With the new dwelling set back some 16m from the road and 4m behind the existing building line, the view from the road would not be greatly changed. Permission for a new driveway to be constructed at the position shown in figure 5 has already been obtained. The garage and parking area could lie beneath the copper beech. 

<P><B>6.	The creation of an appropriate principal house from Avebury</B>

<P>
The principal rooms of Avebury lie in the West wing and we shall call "Avebury West", the principal house to be created. The remainder of the house we may call "Avebury East". There already exists a natural division between the two in the places of the two doors, illustrated in figure 3 which separated the old main house from the "servants quarters".

<P><I>Fig 6:  The oak staircase in Avebury hall</i>
<P>
Prize features of Avebury House at present are the magnificent oak staircase leading to the     spacious landing with stained-glass window shown in figure 6. Both these would be preserved in Avebury West. There would be lounge, dining room and kitchen on the ground floor and four bedrooms, two with en suite and a further bathroom on the first floor.
 
   
<P><td><img src="houseplan.jpg"></td>
<P><I>Fig 7:The house plan at present (not strictly to scale)</i>

<P>
Only minimal changes would have to be made to the main entrance, hall, dining room, staircase and landing which give the main house its distinctive character. The present lounge could be readily turned into a spacious kitchen and living area. The nearby back hall would become the utility room and cloakroom. The major changes required would be on the first floor where a substantial increase in the bathroom facilities is required. It is proposed that part of the present family bathroom be joined with the present spacious airing cupboard to create the main family bathroom. The flat roof above the airing cupboard has been a problem, and should be replaced by a dormer window extending the existing airing cupboard window. Bedroom 1 already has an en-suite shower, toilet and wash basin, and it is proposed that a similar en-suite be constructed in bedroom 3. A new double garage would have to be constructed and it is suggested that this lie in front of the house next to the existing round pond with a parking area in front of the pond and a new drive way as shown on figure 5.

<P><B>7.	Avebury East: a substantial house making best use of the upper floor</B>

<P>
Avebury had been originally built as a house in two parts, one for the family and one for the staff. The style changes abruptly at the two boundaries that would mark the boundary between Avebury East and West. On the lower floor, the grand Avebury West has oak doors and fitments which change to simple pine on the staff side. On the first floor, the finely panelled doors with picture rails and coving change to a simple rectilinear design. The main staircase is of oak and has a wide, shallow tread, while the back stairs is simple, narrow and more steep. The house falls into two parts. The old kitchen could remain in place and the two sculleries converted into a spacious entrance hall. The little courtyard, with its existing outside toilet could be covered in to make a cloakroom and utility room. On the first floor, the probably recent plaster wall separating the existing bathroom and toilet could be demolished and a spacious new bathroom created, even while some space went to the main house bathroom. The sauna bath could remain untouched. 

<P>
It is on the upper floor where Avebury East could open its wings and show its best face.  The only two houses within 100m or so, 21 Milldown Avenue and 11 Ferne Close are both almost at right-angles to this view. Bedrooms 5 and 6 have no such view at present facing north and south respectively. This is surprising as figure 1 clearly shows the gables that face over the West lawn from both bedrooms. Perhaps the family did not want the staff to watch them in the garden?  The height of these "blind" gables exceeds the height of the rooms. New windows in these would enlarge and improve both these bedrooms and would be simple to construct. Bedroom 7 can stay unchanged. In the north side of the main house gable lies the old water tank, and this is the obvious place for the upper floor bathroom. New dormer windows would be needed to provide light, but these would come on the north face of the house overlooking the road and would only overlook the side elevation. There is ample room for a bathroom and replacement tank if the storeroom is used.

<P>The two long corridors lined with storage cupboards that presently occupy the main gables of the house are underused. We propose that all these be swept away and that a large open living area be created in this space. The balcony over the main landing is south facing and overlooks no property nearer than the far side of Ferne Close. However the flat roof has been a source of leaks and was never safe for children with a two story drop beyond its meagre balustrade. We propose that it should be covered over by a new gable and the balcony replaced by a large south facing window set in a new gable. All the long narrow corridors would then disappear and the bedrooms and bathrooms would open from the living area. The line of 15m high Cypress trees to the south of the property enjoys a preservation order. Because the new room faces south, the new window would not be closely overlooked. 
<P>
The east house would require independent access. It is suggested that a new gate and access for cars should be constructed 2 metres from the east border of the property, so that the young oak, (an unusual variety with over-wintering leaves planted by the owners) would separate the new driveway from that of the Coach-house. The square pond would be filled in to make a double car parking area. A new single garage could be constructed alongside the old brick wall separated the house and coach-house driveway.
