<FONT SIZE=4><P>1998-9 <B>Senior Consultant, PenOp: </B>Developer and sales of signature capture 
and verification software. Front-end research in the development, testing, patent drafting and 
documentation of the signature verification algorithm.</P>
<P>1998 <B>Retired</B> full time employment at UKAEA (Regular retirement at age 60)</P>
<P>1996-8 <B><A HREF="jobdesc.htm">Programme Area Manager</B></A> (Special Studies) 
UKAEA Fusion. Management of the &pound; 250K/year programme of research work outside DTI management. 
The work included assessment of proposals, budget control and chairing external 
programme reviews. The post carried membership of the <B> Fusion Management 
Committee.</B></P>
<P>1996-8 <B>Manager of the JET A14 Workpackage</B>:  This involved management of a 
&pound; 385K/year contract with AEA Technology including setting up QA systems and contracts, 
formal approval of work packages, and budget control. </P>
<P>1997- <B>Accredited Meetings Facilitator</B> for the UKAEA. This followed formal 
facilitator training by UKAEA consultants and practical experience with an internal 
Fusion working group. There have been annual training reviews.</P>
<P>1996-8 <B>UKAEA member of the TAGSI</B> (Task Group for System Integrity) risk 
analysis group. This committee of representatives from the Electrical Utilities, 
Universities and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate had the remit of responding 
to formal questions on risk analysis in the nuclear industry posed by its members.</P>
<P>1986-1998 <B>Chairman: Harwell Criticality Committee</B>: This committee had the 
remit of ensuring safety from nuclear criticality accidents at Harwell. I had the 
responsibility for introducing formal Quality Assurance procedures to its work.  
I received formal safety training through AEA Technology's Training Module for 
Safety Working Party Chairmen. I was previously Chairman of the Materials Physics 
Safety Committee from 1974 to 1986, and a member of the Harwell Safety Committee.</P>
<P>1989-1994 <B>Senior Scientist member of Harwell's Neural Network Group.</B>

static and dynamic signature verification <A HREF="chmat/chmat.htm">(patents)</A>.  The signature verification 
systems were featured twice on "Tomorrow's World" and were sold by AEAT after privatization 
to the UK Company PenOp. </P>
<P>1989-91 <B>Chairman: ESPRIT II, ANNIE Project "Pattern Recognition Group"</B>. 
This project was for the Application of Neural Networks for Industry in Europe, 
with industrial partners Siemens (Germany), CETIM (France) and British Aerospace 
and AI Ltd. (UK) and Alpha (Greece). The pattern recognition group worked on defect 
classification in welds and printed circuit boards. It was described by Commission reviewers 
as the "jewel in Annie's crown". The on-line weld defect classification demonstrator 
was selected to represent ESPRIT at the Avignon AI conference in 1991.</P>
<P>1980-1994 <B>Senior Scientist member of the National Non-Destructive Testing Centre, Harwell. 
</B>Winning, managing and performing industrial research contracts from industry. 
These were principally in the areas of residual stress measurement by neutron diffraction, 
microstructural characterisation by neutron small angle scattering, and 
Probability of Detection in X-radiography. Organiser of the one-day meetings  
<I>Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks in NDT</I>, at Northampton in 1996 and 
<I>Neutron Diffraction Techniques for NDE</I> (also guest editor) at Warwick in 1989.</P>
<P>1972-1980 <B>Group Leader in Neutron Physics at AERE Harwell</B> (later Pulsed Neutron Group). 
Leader of a research team with responsibility for neutron scattering studies. 
In particular the industrial contract research programme was developed, and 
instruments designed, built and commissioned on the new pulsed neutron scattering target 
station on the Harwell Linac.
Wrote <A HREF="books.htm">Pulsed Neutron Scatttering</A> book in 1981.      </P>
