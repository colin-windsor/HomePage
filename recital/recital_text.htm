<H1>Hagbourne Church Organ Recital 2025, speaking text</H1>

<P>It’s Science Sunday here at Hagbourne and today you have a working scientist to play to you. Its a good life being a scientist. God's universe is so huge, so complex, so wonderful and so full of apparent miracles. Our sun and billions of stars show the miracle of nuclear fusion. I'll be cycling in tomorrow to Tokamak Energy at Milton Park. There we are trying to save the planet with fusion on earth. There are many tricky questions to answer. Wish us luck. 

<P>You will soon realise that I’m no organist. I'm just a grade 5 pianist who was phoned up by a singing friend 17 years ago: "Would I like to play the organ at Whitchurch"? It’s a gorgeous church by the Thames with a thunderous organ. I ended up playing there happily for 11 years before retiring at 80. 

<P>A year or so later I started at Upton, just a 20 min cycle ride away for me. It has a gorgeous old chamber organ. Its keyboard dates from 1833 along with many of its pipes. It’s sweet sounds hit your ears instantly.

<P>As Mo said in her recital, all organ recitals need some Bach. Here is part of Prelude 23 from the First book of Preludes and Fugues.

<P>
<P>It is a splendid piece to demonstrate intervals. We all know the octive, doubling the pitch. Most will recognise a 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Here we have a 3<SUP>rd</SUP>, where the interval is three tones, then a 4th, a 5th, a 6th, and a 7th, but then:  It is a 9<SUP>th</SUP>. Alone is sounds discordant but in the context it is a gorgeous "scrunch". Please look for 9ths tonight. There are plenty.

<P>Our music is built on mathematics. Around 600 BC the polygot mathematician Pythagorias invented "pure" scales that  depended on simple pitch ratios. Its recorded that he listened to blacksmiths hammering and found that if two hammers gave pitches with the exact ratio 3/2 it was "pleasing to the ear". He built a whole scale going up in 5ths defining F, C, G, D, A, E and B in their respective octaves. This series of notes crops up in the violin tuning G,D,A,E, and in the viola tuning C,G,D,A  It also defines the order we add sharps: I learnt "Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle. In reverse it gives the order of flats.

<P>Around 150 AD Ptolemy improved the scale by introducing other pure ratios, like 4/3 for a 4th, and 5/4 for a 3rd.

<P>In 1752 Bach simplified it all with his equal-tempered scale. His is simple maths: there are 12 semitones in an octave and you just increase the pitch of each semitone by the 12th root of 2 or 1.05946. Fifths are no longer "pure" with a ratio 1.498 rather than 1.5. You need a good <I>ear</I> to tell these difference!

<P>Tonight, I will play some of my own compositions. It makes a change, and they are mercifully easy to play. Most were written for the Church and include voices. I am so grateful to my dear family Jon, Liz, Jane and Mo for singing along. 

<P>I started composing for my children 45 years ago when they were about 7 and 9. They loved nursery rhymes, and loved their toys, so I composed a set of 10 "Tunes for the toys". They sang their rhymes to a cassette tape, which still lives as an MP3 which I will play for Jonathan's song. Here is "My bike" for Liz (she still loves her bike), "My cars" for Jon, and "My crib" for Jane.

<P>I have always had a soft spot for John Betjeman. He was at Magdalen College 20 years before me. In those days the <I>Botanical Garden</I> opposite was a free haven of peace, beauty and science (plants are botanically labelled!). It lies in the shadow of Magdalen tower. He wrote the poem <I>Magdalen Bells</I> in 1960, and I set it to music in 1981 - also around 20 years later. I sent him a tape, and he replied: "I played your cassette and enjoyed it. I don’t mind a bit about the shortened length. Thank you very much for letting me hear it".

<P>
<P><I>Magdalen Bells</I> had its successes. In 1984 I put it in for Wantage Music Festival Composition class. It was beautifully played by the adjudicator Richard Dearing, and won!  Ten years on I entered it for a one-off Magdalen Arts Festival and again it won. On the Festival Day 17th June 30 years ago I got an engraved dish, a quite large cheque and it was sung by a quartet from the college choir.

<P>My children grew up. They honed their singing at our Goring Sunday School. It was a very musical Sunday School with some excellent singers. Soon they were good enough to join the Goring Church Choir.  I wrote the anthem, "Listen to Him". 
<P style="color:red;"> Listen to Him, Liz and Jane)
<P>
<P>In those days Goring Church sang the Marbeke Communion every week. I thought an occasional change might be good and started writing a Communion Setting. First came the "Agnus Dei" and "Kyrie" which the Upton congregation now sing so nicely. Then follow two short sentences we don't usually sing:  "Christ has died" and "Blessing and honour". 
<P style="color:red;"> Agnus Dei (Jane), Kyrie (Liz), Christ has died (Jon), Blessing and honour (all)
<P>
<P>A nice innovation of the 1980 Alternative Service Book was "Introductory sentences" for each week of the Church year. This one was written for the 7th Sunday before Easter. "The Lord is Gracious and merciful and His compassion is over all that He hath made"
<P style="color:red;"> The Lord is Graceous (Mo)
<P>
<P>Goring Church Carol Services were always a treasure. In 1990 I looked through a book of Christina Rossetti’s poetic works and found "Love came down at Christmas". Only later did I realise that another excellent version was in hymn books! Liz sung the solo in that first performance  this old accompanied by the old xylophone. 
<P style="color:red;"> Love came down at Christmas (all)
<P>
<P>Every January in those days Goring did a Panto skillfully produced by Mary Williams. In 1991 it was "The Water Babies" by Charles Kinglsey. Mo was asked to do the keyboards, and she asked me to write her music to the Kinglsey poem "Clear and Cool". 
<P style="color:red;"> Clear and cool (Mo)
<P>
<P>Around 2000 Mo became organist at Streatley Church. Most weeks we sang Mattins and our rector Elias wanted to rejuvenate the Mattins service.  I started writing a setting and by 2004 it had its first performance at a special service when the bishop came to celebrate Sreatley’s new organ. 

<P>When Mo and I got married in September 2005 we sang "Lord, have mercy upon us" exactly as we will sing it now. It will be followed by the "Lord’s prayer", the "Venite", and a little grace written for a Goring Harvest Supper: "Try to grow perfect, Help one another, Be United, Live in peace." 
<P style="color:red;"> Lord have mercy upon us (Mo and Colin), Lord's prayer (Jon), Venite (Mo), "Try to grow perfect (Jon)
<P>
<P>To end let us all sing my "Amen". I will play it four times: first on the organ, then the family will sing it in harmony, then they will sing it in unison. Lastly I will pull out all the stops and I hope you will all sing along. 
<P style="color:red;"> Amen (all)
