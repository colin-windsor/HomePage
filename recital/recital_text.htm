<P><I>It’s Science Sunday here at Hagbourne and today you have a working scientist to play to you. Its a good life being a scientist. God's universe is so huge, so complex, so beautiful, and so full of apparent miracles. There is always more to discover. Our sun and billions of stars show the miracle of nuclear fusion. I'll be cycling in tomorrow to Tokamak Energy at Milton Park. There we are trying to save the planet and bring fusion down to earth. Its a bit like a giant crossword puzzle with many uncertain answers. Wish us luck. </I>

<I>
<P>You will soon realise that I’m no organist. I'm just a grade 5 pianist who was phoned up by a singing friend 17 years ago: "Would I like to play the organ at Whitchurch"? It’s a delightful church by the Thames with a thunderous old organ. I ended up playing there happily for 11 years before retiring at 80.

<P>A year or so later I started at Upton, just a 20 min cycle ride away for me. It has a gorgeous old chamber organ. Its keyboard dates from 1833 along with many of its pipes. It’s sweet sounds hit your ears instantly.</P>


<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<P>As Mo said in her recital, all organ recitals need Bach. Here is part of Prelude 23 from the First book of Preludes and Fugues. 
<BR CLEAR="all">
<IMG SRC="BachPrelude23.jpg" ALT="Bach's 23 Prelude from the first book of Preludes and Fugues" ALIGN="LEFT">
<BR CLEAR="all">
<P>
<P>It is a splendid piece to demonstrate intervals. We all know the octave, doubling the pitch. Most will recognise a 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Here we have a 3<SUP>rd</SUP>, in fact a minor one, then a 4th, a 5th, a 6th, and a 7th, but then:  It is a 9<SUP>th</SUP>. Alone is sounds discordant but in the context it is a gorgeous "scrunch". Please look for 9<SUP>ths </SUP>tonight. They are in almost every piece. (As marked by a red line in the music)

<IMG SRC="Pythagoras.jpg" ALT="Pythagoras" ALIGN="LEFT"> 
<IMG SRC="PythagorianScales.jpg" ALT="PythagorianScales" ALIGN="RIGHT"> 
<P>Our music is built on mathematics. Around 600 BC the mathematician Pythagorias turned his attention to music and invented "pure" scales that depended on simple pitch ratios. Its recorded that he listened to blacksmiths hammering and found that if two hammers gave pitches with the exact ratio 3/2 it was "pleasing to the ear". 

<P>He built a whole scale going up in 5ths defining F, C, G, D, A, E and B in their respective octaves. It made a good major scale. This series of notes crops up in the violin tuning G,D,A,E, and in the viola tuning a 5th down.  It also defines the order we add sharps: I learnt "Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle. In reverse it gives the order of flats.

<P>It's problem was that it only worked for the key to which it was tuned. Modulation was difficult.

<IMG SRC="Bach.jpg" ALT="Bach" ALIGN="RIGHT"> 
<P>In 1752 Bach simplified it all with his equal-tempered scale. He was no mathematician but he knew how to tune a clavichord. There are 12 semitones in an octave and he made each the same. Mathematically you just increase the pitch of each semitone by the 12th root of 2 or 1.05946. Fifths are no longer "pure" with a ratio 1.498 rather than 1.5. You need a good <I>ear</I> to tell these difference! His idea was rapidly taken up, and everyone now uses it. Our organ here uses it.

<P>Tonight, I will play some of my own compositions. Well it makes a change, and they are mercifully easy to play. Most were written for the Church and include voices. I am so grateful to my dear family Jon, Liz, Jane and Mo for singing them. 

<P>I started composing for my children 45 years ago when they were about 7 and 9. They loved nursery rhymes, and they loved their toys, so I composed a set of 10 "Tunes for the toys". At the time they sang their rhymes to a cassette tape, which still lives as an MP3 in my phone.I hope technology will play Jon's song. Here is "My bike" for Liz (she still loves her bike):

<P>I have always had a soft spot for John Betjeman. He was at Magdalen College 20 years before me. In those days the "Botanical Gardens" opposite was a free haven of peace, beauty and science (plants are botanically labelled! I'm afraid its not free anymore). It lies in the shadow of Magdalen tower. He wrote the poem "Magdalen Bells" in 1960 while I was still at Magdalen starting my research.  I set it to music in 1981 - also around 20 years later. I sent him a tape, and he replied: "I played your cassette and enjoyed it. I don’t mind a bit about the shortened length. Thank you very much for letting me hear it".

<P>"Magdalen Bells" had its successes. In 1984 I put it in for Wantage Music Festival Composition class. It was beautifully played by the adjudicator Richard Dearing, and won!  Ten years on I entered it for a one-off Magdalen Arts Festival music section and again it won. On the Festival Day 17th June 30 years ago I got an engraved dish, a quite large cheque and it was sung by a quartet from the college choir.
