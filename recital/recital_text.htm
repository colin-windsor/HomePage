<H1>Hagbourne Church Organ Recital 2025, speaking text</H1>

<P>It’s Science Sunday here at Hagbourne so it's appropriate that you have a working scientist to play to you. I still work 2 days a week trying to save the planet using fusion at Tokamak Energy. You will soon realise that I’m no organist. I'm just a grade 5 pianist who was phoned up by a singing friend 17 years ago: "Would I like to play the organ at Whitchurch in a monthly rota"? It’s a gorgeous church by the Thames with a splendid organ. I ended up playin there happily for 11 years but retired at 80. 

<P>In 2021 I started at Upton, just a 20 min cycle ride away for me. It has a gorgeous old chamber organ, its keyboard dates from 1833 along with many pipes. It’s sweet sounds hit your ears instantly.

<P>As Mo said, all organ recitals need some Bach. Here is part of Prelude 23 from the First book of Preludes and Fugues. ֍

<P>It is a splendid piece to demonstrate intervals. Here we have a 3rd where the interval is three whole tones, then a 4th, a 5th, a 6th, and a 7th, but then:  It is a 9th, B to C# . Alone is sounds discordant but in the context if is gorgeous. It is a suspended 9th, in that the base B is already playing. This is often the case in classical music.  Please look for 9ths tonight. 

<P>Music is all mathematics. Around 600 BC the polygot mathematician Pythagorias invented "pure" scales that  depended on simple pitch ratios. A "pure" 5th chord is the sum of two pitches with the exact ratio 3/2. He found it pleasing to the ear, and built a whole scale going up 5ths defining C, F, D, A, E and B in their octaves. 

<P>The around 150 AD Ptolemy improved the scale by introducing other pure ratios, like 4/3 for a 4th, and 5/4 for a 3rd. Bach simplified all this with his equal-tempered scale. His is all maths: you just increase the pitch of each semitone by the 12th root of 2 or 1.05946. Fifths are no longer "pure" with a ratio 1.498 rather than 1.5. You need a good <I>ear</I> to tell these difference!

<P>Tonight, I will play some of my own compositions. They are mercifully easy to play, and short. Most were written for Goring church and include voices. I am so grateful to my dear family Jon, Liz, Jane and Mo for helping with the singing. I started composing for my children 45 years ago when they were about 7 and 9. They loved nursery rhymes, so I composed a set of 10 "Tunes for the toys". They sang their rhymes to a cassette tape, which still lives as an MP3 which I will play for Jonathan's. Here is "My bike" for Liz, Jonathan "My cars" for Jon, and  "My crib" for Jane. ֍

<P>Jane's song was written in Battle hospital while I was recuperating. There was no piano but I did have Imogen Holst's book "Tune". It's the tune that makes a piece memorable. Science comes in again. It has to have structure, or musical <I>form,</I> that includes both note changes and rhythm. In <I>My crib</I> the first line "Little baby in the manger" defines a shape and rhythm, the second line "Do not week our darling Saviour" has similar form, but is a third down in pitch. The third line "We have come to say we love you" is a further tone down, and rises to a climax at <I><B>love</I></B>. The last line "And to ask for your love too" follows a similar shape but on yet another note, to a final end. Good <I>form</I> means similarity with change. 

<P>I have always had a soft spot for John Betjeman. He was at Magdalen College 20 years before me. In those days the <I>Botanical Garden</I> opposite was a free haven of peace, beauty and science (plants are botanically labelled!). It lies in the shadow of Magdalen tower. He wrote the poem <I>Magdalen Bells</I> in 1960, and I set it to music in 1981 - also 20 years later. I sent him a tape, and he replied: "I played your cassette and enjoyed it. I don’t mind a bit about the shortened length. Thank you very much for letting me hear it".  If you think you’ve heard it before, it was sung at Mo’s first Autumn concert a few years ago. ֍

<P><I>Magdalen Bells</I> has had its successes. In 1984 I put it in for Wantage Music Festival Composition class. It was beautifully played by the adjudicator Richard Dearing, and won!  Ten years on I entered it for a one-off Magdalen Arts Festival and again it won. On the Festival Day 17th June 30 years ago I got an engraved dish, a quite large cheque and it was sung by a quartet from the college choir.

<P>My children grew up. They honed their singing at our Goring Sunday School. One Sunday almost all the school joined the Goring Church Choir. It had no boys so Jon went off to Streatley Church.  I wrote the anthem, "Listen to Him". ֍

<P>In those days Goring Church sang the Marbeke Communion every week. I thought an occasional change might be good and started writing a Communion Setting. First came the "Agnus Dei" and "Kyrie" which the Upton congregation sing so nicely. Then follow the two short sentences we don't usually sing:  "Christ has died" and "Blessing and honour". ֍

<P>A nice innovation of the 1980 Alternative Service Book was "Introductory sentences" for each week of the Church year. "The Lord is Gracious" was written for the 7th Sunday before Easter. "The Lord is Gracious and merciful and His compassion is over all that He hath made" ֍

<P>Goring Church Carol Services were always a treasure. In 1990 I found "Love came down at Christmas" in a book I had of Rossetti’s poetic works. Only later did I realise that another version was in hymn books! Liz sung the solo that first performance and will do it again. 

<P>Every January in those days Goring did a Panto produced by Mary Williams. In 1991 it was "Water Babies" by Charles Kinglsey. Mo was asked to do the keyboards, and she asked me to write her music. Here is "Clear and Cool". 

<P>Around 2000 Mo became organist at Streatley Church. Most weeks we sang Matins and our dear rector Elias wanted to rejuvenate the mattins service.  I started writing a setting and by 2004 it was completed and first performed when the Bishop came to a service to celebrate Sreatley’s new organ. When Mo and I got married in September 2005 we sang "Lord, have mercy upon us" exactly as we will sing it now. It will be followed by the "Lord’s prayer", the "Venite", and from earlier, a little grace written for a Goring Harvest Supper: "Try to grow perfect" ֍

<P>To end let us all sing my "Amen". I will play it four times: first on the organ, then the family will sing it in harmony, then they will sing it in unison. Lastly I will pull out all the stops and I hope you will all sing along. ֍
