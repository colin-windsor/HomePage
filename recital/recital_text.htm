<H1>Hagbourne Church Organ Recital 2025, speaking text</H1>

<P>It’s Science Sunday here at Hagbourne so it's appropriate that you have a working scientist to play to you. Yes, I still work formally 2 days a week trying to save the planet using fusion at Tokamak Energy nearby at Milton Park. You will soon realise that I’m no organist. I'm just a grade 5 pianist who was phoned up by a singing friend 17 years ago: "Would I like to play the organ at Whitchurch in a monthly rota"? It’s a gorgeous church by the Thames with a splendid organ. I ended up playing there happily for 11 years before retiring at 80. 

<P>In 2021 I started at Upton, just a 20 min cycle ride away for me. It has a gorgeous old chamber organ, its keyboard dates from 1833 along with many pipes. It’s sweet sounds hit your ears instantly.

<P>As Mo said in her recital, all organ recitals need some Bach. Here is part of Prelude 23 from the First book of Preludes and Fugues. ֍

<P>It is a splendid piece to demonstrate intervals. Here we have a 3rd where the interval is three whole tones, then a 4th, a 5th, a 6th, and a 7th, but then:  It is a 9th, B to C# . Alone is sounds discordant but in the context if is gorgeous "scrunch". Please look for 9ths tonight. There are plenty.

<P>Music is built on mathematics. Around 600 BC the polygot mathematician Pythagorias invented "pure" scales that  depended on simple pitch ratios. Its recored that he listened to blacksmiths hammering and found that if two hammers gave pitches with the exact ratio 3/2 it was pleasing to the ear. He built a whole scale going up in 5ths defining C, F, D, A, E and B in respective octaves. 

<P>The around 150 AD Ptolemy improved the scale by introducing other pure ratios, like 4/3 for a 4th, and 5/4 for a 3rd. 

<P>Bach simplified it all in 1752 with his equal-tempered scale. His is simplle maths: you just increase the pitch of each semitone by the 12th root of 2 or 1.05946. Fifths are no longer "pure" with a ratio 1.498 rather than 1.5. You need a good <I>ear</I> to tell these difference!

<P>Tonight, I will play some of my own compositions. They are mercifully fairly easy to play, and short. Most were written for Goring church and include voices. I am so grateful to my dear family Jon, Liz, Jane and Mo for singing along. 

<P>I started composing for my children 45 years ago when they were about 7 and 9. They loved nursery rhymes, so I composed a set of 10 "Tunes for the toys". They sang their rhymes to a cassette tape, which still lives as an MP3 which I will play for Jonathan's. Here is "My bike" for Liz, Jonathan "My cars" for Jon, and  "My crib" for Jane. ֍

<P>Jane's song was written in Battle hospital where I recuperated for a week or so. There was no piano but I did have Imogen Holst's book "Tune". It's the tune of a piece that makes it memorable. Science comes in again. It has to have structure, or musical <I>form,</I>.This includes both pitch changes and rhythm. In <I>My crib</I> the first line "Little baby in the manger" defines a shape and rhythm. Note the starting three crotchets, followed by two rising quavers. the second line "Do not week our darling Saviour" has similar form, but is a third down in pitch. The third line "We have come to say we love you" is a further tone down, and rises to a high climax on the word <I><B>love</I></B>. The last line "And to ask for your love too" starts on yet another note follows a similar shape to a final end. Good <I>form</I> means "always similar", "always different". 

<P>I have always had a soft spot for John Betjeman. He was at Magdalen College 20 years before me. In those days the <I>Botanical Garden</I> opposite was a free haven of peace, beauty and science (plants are botanically labelled!). It lies in the shadow of Magdalen tower. He wrote the poem <I>Magdalen Bells</I> in 1960, and I set it to music in 1981 - also around 20 years later. I sent him a tape, and he replied: "I played your cassette and enjoyed it. I don’t mind a bit about the shortened length. Thank you very much for letting me hear it".֍

<P><I>Magdalen Bells</I> has had its successes. In 1984 I put it in for Wantage Music Festival Composition class. It was beautifully played by the adjudicator Richard Dearing, and won!  Ten years on I entered it for a one-off Magdalen Arts Festival and again it won. On the Festival Day 17th June 30 years ago I got an engraved dish, a quite large cheque and it was sung by a quartet from the college choir.

<P>My children grew up. They honed their singing at our Goring Sunday School. It was a very musical Sunday School. I remember that every child who came to us learnt to sing in tune.  One Sunday several of them joined the Goring Church Choir. It had no boys so Jon went off to Streatley Church.  I wrote the anthem, "Listen to Him". ֍

<P>In those days Goring Church sang the Marbeke Communion every week. I thought an occasional change might be good and started writing a Communion Setting. First came the "Agnus Dei" and "Kyrie" which the Upton congregation now sing so nicely. Then follow the two short sentences we don't usually sing:  "Christ has died" and "Blessing and honour". ֍

<P>A nice innovation of the 1980 Alternative Service Book was "Introductory sentences" for each week of the Church year. "The Lord is Gracious" was written for the 7th Sunday before Easter. "The Lord is Gracious and merciful and His compassion is over all that He hath made" ֍

<P>Goring Church Carol Services were always a treasure. In 1990 I found "Love came down at Christmas" in a book I had of Christina Rossetti’s poetic works. Only later did I realise that another excellent version was in hymn books! Liz sung the solo in that first performance with this actual xylophone and will do it again. 

<P>Every January in those days Goring did a Panto skillfully produced by Mary Williams. In 1991 it was "The Water Babies" by Charles Kinglsey. Mo was asked to do the keyboards, and she asked me to write her music to the Kinglsey poem "Clear and Cool". 

<P>Around 2000 Mo became organist at Streatley Church. Most weeks we sang Mattins and our dear rector Elias wanted to rejuvenate the Mattins service.  I started writing a setting and by 2004 it was completed and first performed when the Bishop came to a service to celebrate Sreatley’s new organ. When Mo and I got married in September 2005 we sang "Lord, have mercy upon us" exactly as we will sing it now. It will be followed by the "Lord’s prayer", the "Venite", and a little grace written for a Goring Harvest Supper: "Try to grow perfect" ֍

<P>To end let us all sing my "Amen". I will play it four times: first on the organ, then the family will sing it in harmony, then they will sing it in unison. Lastly I will pull out all the stops and I hope you will all sing along. ֍
