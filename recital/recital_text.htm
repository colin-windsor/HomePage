<P>Colin's spoken script will be shown in italic:

<P><I>It’s Science Sunday here at Hagbourne and today you have a working scientist to play to you. Its a good life being a scientist. God's universe is so huge, so complex, so beautiful, and so full of apparent miracles. There is always more to discover. Our sun and billions of stars show the miracle of nuclear fusion. I'll be cycling in tomorrow to Tokamak Energy at Milton Park. There we are trying to save the planet and bring fusion down to earth. Its a bit like a giant crossword puzzle with many uncertain answers. Wish us luck.

<P>You will soon realise that I’m no organist. I'm just a grade 5 pianist who was phoned up by a singing friend 17 years ago: "Would I like to play the organ at Whitchurch"? It’s a delightful church by the Thames with a thunderous old organ. I ended up playing there happily for 11 years before retiring at 80. 

<P><IMG SRC="StMaryUpton.jpg" ALT="St Mary church at Upton just South of Hagbourne" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<P>A year or so later I started at Upton, just a 20 min cycle ride away for me. It has a gorgeous old chamber organ. Its keyboard dates from 1833 along with many of its pipes. It’s sweet sounds hit your ears instantly.</P>

<P>As Mo said in her recital, all organ recitals need Bach. Here is part of Prelude 23 from the First book of Preludes and Fugues.

<P>
<P>It is a splendid piece to demonstrate intervals. We all know the octave, doubling the pitch. Most will recognise a 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Here we have a 3<SUP>rd</SUP>, in fact a minor one, then a 4th, a 5th, a 6th, and a 7th, but then:  It is a 9<SUP>th</SUP>. Alone is sounds discordant but in the context it is a gorgeous "scrunch". Please look for 9ths tonight. They are in almost every piece.

<IMG SRC="Pythagoras.jpg" ALT="Pythagoras" ALIGN="LEFT"> 
<IMG SRC="PythagorianScales.jpg" ALT="PythagorianScales" ALIGN="RIGHT"> 
<P>Our music is built on mathematics. Around 600 BC the mathematician Pythagorias turned his attention to music and invented "pure" scales that depended on simple pitch ratios. Its recorded that he listened to blacksmiths hammering and found that if two hammers gave pitches with the exact ratio 3/2 it was "pleasing to the ear". 
 <P>He built a whole scale going up in 5ths defining F, C, G, D, A, E and B in their respective octaves. It made a good major scale. This series of notes crops up in the violin tuning G,D,A,E, and in the viola tuning a 5th down.  It also defines the order we add sharps: I learnt "Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle. In reverse it gives the order of flats.

<IMG SRC="Bach.jpg" ALT="Bach" ALIGN="RIGHT"> 
<P>In 1752 Bach simplified it all with his equal-tempered scale. He was no mathematician but he knew how to tune a clavichord. There are 12 semitones in an octave and he made each the same. Mathematically you just increase the pitch of each semitone by the 12th root of 2 or 1.05946. Fifths are no longer "pure" with a ratio 1.498 rather than 1.5. You need a good <I>ear</I> to tell these difference! His idea was rapidly taken up, and everyone now uses it,

<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>Tonight, I will play some of my own compositions. It makes a change, and they are mercifully easy to play. Most were written for the Church and include voices. I am so grateful to my dear family Jon, Liz, Jane and Mo for singing them. 


<P>I started composing for my children 45 years ago when they were about 7 and 9. They loved nursery rhymes, and they loved their toys, so I composed a set of 10 "Tunes for the toys". At the time they sang their rhymes to a cassette tape, which still lives as an MP3 in my phone which I hope technology will play Jon's song. Here is "My bike" for Liz (she still loves her bike):

<P>I have always had a soft spot for John Betjeman. He was at Magdalen College 20 years before me. In those days the <I>Botanical Garden</I> opposite was a free haven of peace, beauty and science (plants are botanically labelled! I'm afraid its not free anymore). It lies in the shadow of Magdalen tower. He wrote the poem <I>Magdalen Bells</I> in 1960 while I was still at Magdalen starting my research.  I set it to music in 1981 - also around 20 years later. I sent him a tape, and he replied: "I played your cassette and enjoyed it. I don’t mind a bit about the shortened length. Thank you very much for letting me hear it".

<IMG SRC="MagdalenCollegeChoirQuartet.jpg" ALT="The quartet from Magdalen College Choir who sang it at the festival" ALIGN="LEFT"><P><I>Magdalen Bells</I> had its successes. In 1984 I put it in for Wantage Music Festival Composition class. It was beautifully played by the adjudicator Richard Dearing, and won!  Ten years on I entered it for a one-off Magdalen Arts Festival music section and again it won. On the Festival Day 17th June 30 years ago I got an engraved dish, a quite large cheque and it was sung by a quartet from the college choir.

<P>My children grew up. They honed their singing at our Goring Sunday School. It was a very musical Sunday School with some excellent singers. Soon they were good enough to join the Goring Church Choir.  I wrote the anthem, "Listen to Him".

<P>
<P>In those days Goring Church sang the Marbeke Communion every week. I thought an occasional change might be good and started writing a Communion Setting. We will sing 4 pieces. First the "Agnus Dei" and "Kyrie" which the Upton congregation now sing so nicely. Then follow two short sentences we don't usually sing:  "Christ has died" and "Blessing and honour". 
<P style="color:red;"> Agnus Dei (Jane), Kyrie (Liz), Christ has died (Jon), Blessing and honour (all)

<P>Goring Church Carol Services the Sunday after Christmas were always a treasure. In 1990 I had on my bookshelf Christina Rossetti’s collected works. I found "Love came down at Christmas". Only coming to Hagbourne did I realise that another excellent version was in hymn books! Liz will sing the solo as in the first performance, accompanied by the old xylophone I made for my children.

<P>Every January in those days Goring did a Panto skillfully produced by Mary Williams. In 1991 it was "The Water Babies" by Charles Kinglsey. Mo was asked to do the keyboards, and she asked me to write her music to the Kinglsey poem "Clear and Cool".

<P>Around 2000 Mo became organist at Streatley Church. Most weeks we sang Mattins and one evening over dinner our rector Elias said he wanted to rejuvenate the Mattins service.  I started writing a setting and by 2004 it had its first performance at a special service to celebrate Sreatley’s new organ lead by  the Bishop of Dorchester. 
<P>When Mo and I got married at Streatley Church in September 2005 we sang "Lord, have mercy upon us" exactly as we will sing it now.

<P style="color:red;"> Lord have mercy upon us (Mo and Colin), Lord's prayer (Jon), Venite (Mo), "Try to grow perfect (Jon)
<P>
<P>To end let us all sing my "Amen". I will play it four times: first on the organ, then the family will sing it in harmony, then they will sing it in unison. Lastly I will pull out the stops and I want you all to stand up and sing out our thanks for God's gift of music.
