<H1>Hagbourne Church Organ Recital 2025</H1>
<P><HR></P>
<L>
<P>It’s Science Sunday here at Hagbourne. Today you have a scientist to play to you.I’m no organist, just a grade 5 pianist who was phoned up by a singing friend 17 years ago: "Would I like to play at Whitchurch in a monthly rota"? It’s a gorgeous church by the Thames with a splendid organ, and paid RCSM rates. I said yes. I had lessons from Jeremy Boughton and built an electronic organ to practice on. It went OK,  but the rota did not work. One went to college, one died, and one retired at 80, and I read in the Parish Magazine that I was organist and choir master.  I played there happily for 11 years. Then I moved to Upton, just a 20 min cycle ride away. It has a gorgeous old chamber organ, its keyboard dates from 1833 along with many pipes. It’s sweet sounds hit your ears instantly. With no pedals, and only one manual, it suits me fine. 

<P>As Mo said, all organ recitals need some Bach. Here is part of Prelude 23 from the First book of Preludes and Fugues. ֍

<P>It is a splendid piece to demonstrate intervals. Here we have a 3rd where the interval is three whole tones, then a 4th, a 5th, a 6th, and a 7th, but then:  It is a 9th, B to C# . Alone is sounds discordant but in the context if is gorgeous. It is a suspended 9th, in that the base B is already playing. This is often the case in classical music.  Please look for 9ths. They are in all my pieces except one!

<P>Music is all mathematics. The Pythagorian "pure" scales date from ~600BC, and depended on simple frequency ratios. A "pure 5th chord is the sum of two frequencies with the exact ratio 3/2. If the lower one is C, the upper one is f and going down an octave defines F in the scale. He found it pleasant to the ear. The next 5th up defines D and so on. Ptolemy around 150 AD improved the scale by introducing other pure ratios, like 4/3 for a 4th, and 5/4 for a 3rd. More  "dissonant" intervals, like a 7th have the complicated 15/8 ratio. Bach simplified all this with his equal-tempered scale. His scale is obtained by all semitones increasing their frequency by the 12th root of 2 or 1.05946. Fifths are no longer in the pure ratio 1.5 but 1.498. You need a good "ear" to tell these difference!


<P>Tonight, I will play some of my own compositions. They are mercifully easy to play, and short. Most were written for Goring church and include voices. I am so grateful to my dear family Jon, Liz, Jane and Mo for helping with the singing. I started composing 45 years ago for my children. They loved nursery rhymes, so I composed a set of 10 "Tunes for the toys". They sang their rhymes to a cassette tape, which still lives as an MP3. Here is "My bike" for Liz, "My cars" for Jon, and  "My crib" for Jane. ֍

<P>Jane's song has a story. It was written in Battle hospital for a while. There was no piano but I did have Stainer's <I>Harmony</I> and Imogen <I>Tune</I>. Composing is not easy. You have to conceive the piece as a whole. The moment the first line is written down, it gets stuck in your head. You have to remain flexible until it is finished. The <I>tune</I> is what makes a piece memorable. Science come in again. It has to have <I>form</I>. In <I>My crib</I> the first line defines a shape and rhythm, the second line has similar form, but a third down. The third line is a further tone down, and rises to a climax at <I>love</I>.Good <I>form</I> means plenty of similarity but always a change. 

<P>I have always had a soft spot for John Betjeman. He was at Magdalen College 20 years before me. In those days the <I>Botanical Garden</I> opposite was a free haven of peace, beauty and science (plants are botanically labelled!). It lies in the shadow of Magdalen tower. He wrote the poem <I>Magdalen Bells</I> in 1960, and I set it to music in 1981 - also 20 years later. I sent him a tape, and he replied: "I played your cassette and enjoyed it. I don’t mind a bit about the shortened length. Thank you very much for letting me hear it". In 1984 I put it in for Wantage Music Festival Composition class. It was beautifully played by the adjudicator Richard Dearing, and it won!  Ten years on I entered it for a one-off Magdalen Arts Festival and again it won. On Festival Day 17th June 1995 I got an engraved dish, a quite large cheque and it was sung by a quartet from the college choir. If you think you’ve heard it before, it was sung at Mo’s first Autumn concert a few years ago.֍

<P>My children grew up. They honed their singing at our Goring Sunday School and one Sunday almost all the group joined the Goring Church Choir. It had no boys so Jonathan went off to Streatley Church.  I wrote the anthem, "Listen to Him". ֍

<P>In those days Goring Church sang the Marbeke Communion every week. I thought an occasional change might be good and started writing a Communion Setting. First came the "Agnus Dei", originally "O lamb of God", although the "O" disappeared in the 1980 "Alternative Service Book" before it was ever sung. Then follows the Kyrie and two short sentences not sung here, 
 "Christ has died" and "Blessing and honour". ֍

<P>I hardly played the organ at all in those days. Evelyn Fisher was our superb organist at Goring Church. Only later did I appreciate how good she was. She was President of the Berkshire Organists Association in 1979-80, just when was composing! She accompanied our young singers so sensitively. A nice innovation of the 1980 ASB was "Introductory sentences" for each week of the Church year. "The Lord is Gracious" was written for the 7th Sunday before Easter. ֍

<P>Goring Church Carol Services were always a treasure. In 1990 I found "Love came down at Christmas" in a book I had of Rossetti’s poetic works. Only later did I realise that another version was in hymn books! Liz sung the solo. 

<P>Every January  Goring did a Panto produced by Mary Williams. In 1991 it was "Water Babies" by Charles Kinglsey. Mo was asked to do the keyboards, and she asked me to write her music. Here is "Clear and Cool". 

<P>Around 2000 Mo became organist at Streatley Church. Most weeks we sang Matins.  Our dear rector Elias wanted to rejuvenate the mattins service and  I started writing a setting. By 2004 it was completed and performed when the Bishop came to a service to celebrate Sreatley’s new organ. When  Mo and I got married in September 2005 we sang "Lord, have mercy upon us" exactly as we will sing it now. It will be followed by the "Lord’s prayer",  and the "Venite" ֍

<P>Here is a little grace: "Try to grow perfect" ֍

<P>To end let us all sing my "Amen". I will play it four times: first on the organ, then the family will sing it in harmony, then in unison, then I hope you will all sing it. ֍
