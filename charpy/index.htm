<p><b>Abstract</b>
<p>
A prediction has been made of the Charpy ductile-brittle transition temperature at high
irradiation levels from a dataset of 459 low-activation ferritic/martensitic steels. It follows 
a similar study of the yield stress of some 1811 similar alloys (Windsor et al, Modelling Simul. 
Mater. Sci. Eng. 16 (2008) 025005). Neural networks have previously been used by 
Cottrell et al (Journal of Nuclear Materials 367-370, 2007, 603-609) to model the 
Charpy ductile-brittle transition temperature of these alloys. The same dataset has 
been used in this study, but has been divided into a training set containing the majority 
of the dataset with low irradiation levels, and a test set which contains just those 
alloys which have been irradiated above a given level. For example, some 7.2% of the 
dataset was irradiated above 20 dpa. Good predictions were made using two different 
codes and methods. As with the yield stress prediction, the target-driven components 
method, where linear combinations of the atomic inputs are chosen to reduce the test 
residual, achieved the best results.


<p><b>1. Introduction</b> 
<P>The Charpy test measures the toughness of a material: that is, its ability to absorb 
energy during fracture [3].  The experimental work used in this paper used sub-sized 
specimens made by machining 3.3x3.3 mm<SUP>2</SUP> rods with a 45<SUP>o</SUP> angle notch 
in the centre. A heavy hammer is swung onto the specimen and the energy absorbed 
during fracture is measured by recording how far the hammer rises beyond the specimen. 
This measurement alone is somewhat qualitative, but more quantitative information 
can be obtained by recording the results as a function of specimen temperature. 
Most ferritic alloys undergo a “ductile to brittle” transition. At high temperatures 
the fracture is ductile with relatively high energy absorption. As the specimen 
temperature is reduced there is a transition to brittle fracture, with much 
lower energy absorption. The fracture surface also changes from a ‘torn’ ductile 
fracture surface to a rough surface showing inter-granular separation. The change 
with temperature is generally quite sharp and from the central temperature of the 
distribution a ductile to brittle transition temperature may be reliably inferred. 
This work is concerned with the ductile-brittle transition temperature shift 
(<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>DBTT) 
as a function of irradiation. An example of the Charpy curve and the effects 
of radiation are shown in figure 1 [4]. The un-irradiated alloys are assigned a 
zero shift, and the change in temperature is measured as a function of irradiation level.
<IMG SRC="chfig1.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">

and after irradiation to 10 and 17 dpa at 365ºC in the Fast Flux Test Facility  [4].</B>




<P>It is known that specimen size affects the ductile–brittle transition temperature in 
Charpy impact testing [5], and there is some evidence that sub-sized Charpy tests provide 
non-conservative estimates of embrittlement [6]. However since this paper deals only with 
sub-sized specimens we expect our predictions to be internally consistent.

<P>The importance of the Charpy toughness test is evident from its use in the 
British Energy R6 validated procedure for assessing the integrity of structures containing 
defects against failure under operational or fault loads [7]. Material toughness may be 
analysed using the Beremin model which is able to express the fracture probability in 
terms of the Weibull parameters fitted to the Charpy data [8].  

<P>The database used in this work is concerned with irradiated low-activation 
martensitic steels, and was compiled from the literature by Yamamoto et al [9]. 
In all some 459 specimens were included in the database with irradiation levels 
up to the fusion reactor relevant range of order 100 dpa (although the particle 
energies are lower than those for fusion irradiation). Figure 2 shows the 
ductile-brittle shift with irradiation as a function of irradiation level.

<IMG SRC="chfig2.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<P><B>Figure 2: The change in ductile to brittle transition temperature in degrees 
Kelvin with irradiation level measured as a function of irradiation level in 
displacements per atom (dpa). The full dataset has been divided into training data 
at low irradiation levels (open circles) and test data at irradiation levels 
above 20 dpa (closed circles). </B>


<P>The figure shows many data at low irradiation levels, with some 7.2% of the 
database at levels greater than 20 dpa. There is an appreciable spread 
(over 250 degrees K) in the Charpy shift at any given irradiation level, 
partly because of the varying compositions of the individual steels, and 
partly because of the varying normalising temperature, normalising time, 
tempering temperature and tempering time which differ for the different 
steels at the same irradiation level. It will be shown later in figure 3 
that the inclusion of these variables leads to a much reduced spread in 
the fit to the training data of around 50 K. On an expanded irradiation 
level scale it is seen that all the Charpy shifts for un-irradiated specimens 
are indeed zero. However for irradiation levels around 5 dpa, the measured shift 
can and does have positive or negative values. It is seen that the trend of the 
average shift rises up to around 25 dpa, as illustrated in figure 1, then falls 
because of irradiation softening [9].

<P>A fusion reactor needs structural steels that will be able to withstand 
irradiation levels in the range 20 to 90 dpa, but obtaining high-dose data 
is expensive and time-consuming. As figure 2 suggests, there is at present 
only limited data in this range. An objective of this work is to determine 
how well Charpy measurements taken at lower irradiation levels may be used 
to predict properties in the reactor-relevant range. It is important to note 
that there are likely errors in both the Charpy shift and the irradiation dose 
axes of these graphs. An estimate of the Charpy shift error can be made from 
the work of Mueller et al [10] as around ±20 K. The irradiation dose error 
arises from the difficulties of integrating the reactor or accelerator power 
over an irradiation which may last many months or years. It is likely to be 
several percent. A further relevant source of errors is in the measurement 
of alloy chemical compositions, which are also subject to an uncertainty of 
several percent. In some additional cases these were also incompletely 
described in the database and had to be estimated from other sources in 
the literature. Where the missing information was related to impurities, 
which are inevitably present (i.e. Cu, O), the composition was set to be 
equal to the average of the available data.




<P><p><b>2. Performance assessment: the test residual</b>

<P>A problem, common with all highly-flexible least-squares fitting procedures, 
is that in order to test the fit, the dataset must be divided into subsets of 
“training” and “test” data, where none of the test data has been included in 
the training process. This paper will use the root mean squared least squares 
test residual <I>R<SUB>test</SUB></I> defined as the square root of the summed 
squared difference between the network targets <I>T<SUB>i</SUB></I> and 
calculated network outputs <I>O<SUB>i</SUB></I>, divided by the number of 
test examples <I>N<SUB>test</SUB></I>

<P><I>R<SUB>test</SUB>={[
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>S</span><SUB>test</SUB>
( T<SUB>i</SUB> - O<SUB>i</SUB>)<SUP2</SUP>]/N<SUB>test</SUB>}<SUP>1/2</SUP>					</I>.....(1)

<P>where the summation <I>i</I> includes only the test examples chosen from the dataset. 
Here <I>T<SUB>i</SUB></I> are the network targets, essentially the 
experimentally-obtained values of the 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>DBTT
for each example alloy in the dataset. <I>O<SUB>i</SUB></I> are the outputs 
of the trained neural network. With the Charpy ductile-brittle transition 
temperature shift (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>DBTT) as target, 
the residual has the units of degrees K and is essentially the root mean square 
deviation between actual and predicted shifts. The main neural networks code 
used is an adapted version of the MAGEOM code written by Colin Roach and 
Paul Haynes under the direction of Chris Bishop [11]. It is able to 
perform the target-driven components method described in section 3. It does 
not contain any error determination in the ways used in reference [2]. 
To supplement this code, its main conclusions were confirmed with the 
“BIGBACK” code written by David MacKay [12]. This was run using the interface 
code “Model Manager” [13]. It includes a full Bayesian error treatment. 
In particular it is able to lower the weightings of irrelevant variables 
automatically.

<P>If all the dataset had been used for training as described in Cottrell 
et al [2] then, as considered by them, the optimal number of hidden units 
is between 4 and 6.


<P><p><b>3. Neural networks used in a predictive mode,</b>



<p>The long term objective of this study is to predict the change in Charpy shift 
under the conditions of a fusion reactor, say for irradiation levels above 40 dpa. 
There are at present very few data in this region and the present study seeks to 
remedy this by asking whether predictions from lower irradiation levels might 
make a useful prediction at fusion reactor levels, as well as using the modelling technique to provide insight into radiation embrittlement mechanisms. While the accuracy of such predictions is unlikely to be good enough for structural safety evaluation, it may well be sufficient to say whether today’s alloys, with measurements at only relatively low irradiation levels, may be useful for reactor applications, or whether new alloy development is essential. As more data become available at high irradiation levels we expect our model to be more precise.
The neural network predictions, used for this dataset by Cottrell <I>et al</i> [2] 
made no attempt to address this problem. They used the conventional approach, 
dividing the whole dataset into equal randomised training and test datasets, 
and optimising the network test performance. A different strategy is used here 
and was used in our earlier work on yield stress under irradiation [1]. 
Here the data at low irradiation levels is used as training data, and the 
data at high irradiation levels as test data. There is therefore no uncertainty 
in test performance arising from differing choices of training data. 
The irradiation level of 20 dpa has been chosen here since it leaves a reasonable 
proportion (7.2%) of the dataset for testing. It will be shown that, 
at this level, the network is indeed a good predictor of performance, and that 
such networks optimised for test at high irradiation level can be quite different 
for those optimised for performance over the whole dataset.

<P>The dataset contained a single target parameter, the change in 
ductile/brittle transition temperature, and 26 input variables. The input variables 
may be divided into 7 non-atomic inputs
<P>i)	normalising temperature, range 273-1473 K
<BR>ii)	normalising time, range 0-2 hours
<BR>iii)	tempering temperature, range 273-1053 K
<BR>iv)	tempering time, range 0-780 hours
<BR>v)	irradiation temperature, range 333-823 K
<BR>vi)	irradiation dose, range 0-100 dpa

<P>The remaining 19 input variables detail the atomic fractions of selected elements. 
These include the elements C,	Cr, W, Mo, Ta, V, Si, Mn, N, Al, B, Co,	Cu, Nb, Ni, 
P, S, Ti and Zr. The ranges of some of these atomic fractions are very small.

<IMG SRC="chfig3.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<P><B>Figure 3: The calculated value of the shift in Charpy transition temperature 
compared to its actual value for test data having irradiation levels greater than 20 dpa. 
The calculations used the BIGBACK code including all the available input variables. 
Hidden unit numbers ran from 1 to 20 and there were 5 seed values at each stage. 
The run number is 889, and the test residual is 120.0 K. The best individual  
result corresponded to 3 hidden units. </B>



<P>Figure 3 shows an example of results from the BIGBACK code, including 
all the inputs detailed above, when training is carried out for the examples with 
irradiation levels below 20 dpa and testing is for those examples at greater 
irradiations. This is not the normal usage of BIGBACK which might conventionally 
divide the dataset into a 50% training dataset and 50% test dataset. 
It rather considers how it might best use the training data available to 
“extrapolate” into the high irradiation range not covered by the training data. 
It is seen that the open squares representing the training data performance 
fall reasonably close to the dashed line representing perfect performance. 
The closed squares representing test data with errors are more scattered 
although do give a useful predictive accuracy considering that some points are 
highly extrapolated beyond the training data. Note that the limited size of 
the total dataset meant that no “validation dataset” was used so that operations 
like the optimisation of the hidden units were performed on the test dataset.

<P>Using the test data above and for a particular irradiation level, it is 
easy to see which of the non-atomic “fixed” inputs is most significant, 
by first including all fixed inputs and then removing one of the inputs 
and noting the new residual. Such results are shown in figure 4. 
The left-hand column (light) is when all fixed inputs are included. 
The other columns (dark) have the input noted omitted from the network. 
If the data >20 dpa form the test data the prediction accuracy is generally 
similar or higher, showing that the variable was helpful. However 
the irradiation temperature input variable is not helpful with a residual 
less than when the variable was included.


<IMG SRC="chfig4.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<P><B>Figure 4: The test data residual when the change in ductile to brittle 
transition temperature is evaluated from a 5 hidden unit neural network 
including all the fixed non-atomic inputs “All fixed”, (light) and with 
the other non-atomic variables detailed omitted (dark). This is done for 
test data at irradiation levels above 20. It is seen that omitting the 
irradiation temperature input Tirr gives a significantly lower residual.</B>


<P>Turning to the atomic fraction input variables the most relevant variables 
may be considered by the forward sequential selection of features method [14]. 
Each atomic fraction variable is added in turn to a network already 
containing the 5 or 6 fixed inputs depending on whether the irradiation 
temperature variable is included. Such results are shown in figure 5 for 
test irradiations > 20 dpa in the absence of the irradiation temperature input. 
The most helpful atomic inputs to add to the network are those first in the list: 
C, N, Co and V. A few are above the dashed line and so are not helpful to add 
at this stage. This result can change later when other atomic inputs have been added.

<IMG SRC="chfig5.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<P><B>Figure 5: The test data residual when all the potential atomic inputs are 
added to the fixed variables. The original residual when only the fixed inputs 
are added is shown by the dashed line.  Almost all inputs are helpful. 
Carbon, Nitrogen, Cobalt and Vanadium are the most helpful at this stage and 
define the order for the determination of linear combinations. </B>

<P>Following the forward selection of features, the atomic variable whose addition 
gives the lowest test residual is chosen to be included alongside the fixed variables 
in the next stage. All the remaining atomic variables are then added in turn to the 
current network and again the atomic input giving the lowest test residual is 
included in the following stage. The process is repeated until the addition of 
further atomic variables fails to cause any reduction in the residual.

<IMG SRC="chfig6.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<P><B><P>Figure 6: The test data residual during the forward selection of 
features process. Those atomic inputs are added which lead to the largest reduction 
of the test residual.  The process is continued until there is no further reduction 
in the residual. This run is for 13 hidden units, with test irradiation levels 
above 20 dpa, the irradiation temperature input excluded. There were 800 iterations 
and the results are the best 10 out of 20 runs.</B>


<P>Figure 6 shows this process during the addition of the atomic inputs for 
C, Co, Si, Ta, N, Cr, Mo and Ni. All these inputs cause a successive reduction 
in the test residual. However at the final stage, no other atomic input causes 
a reduction in the test residual.

<P>An important variable is the number of hidden units. In general the residual 
obtained will show a minimum as a function of hidden unit number. If the number 
of hidden units is too low the network will have insufficient adjustable 
variables to fit even the training data. However if the number of hidden units 
is too high the details of the training data may be “over fitted” to a high accuracy 
but at the expense of the fit to the test data. The optimal hidden unit number 
may be estimated by repeating the whole forward selection process as a function 
of hidden unit number as in figure 7.

<IMG SRC="chfig7.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<P><B><P>Figure 7: Open triangles show the test data residual at the end of the 
forward selection of features process as a function of the hidden unit number. 
The minimum exists at 11 hidden units but is very shallow. The closed squares, 
to be discussed later correspond to the target driven components method for the same data.</B>


<P><p><b>4. The target-driven components method for dimensionality reduction</B>

<P>This method was described in [1]. It seeks to promote the ideal of dimensionality reduction 
by combining existing atomic inputs <I>A<SUB>j</SUB></I> into new inputs, <I>X<SUB>m</SUB></I>, 
composed of linear combinations of existing atomic inputs.

<P><I>X<SUB>m</SUB>= 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>S</span><SUB>j</SUB> P<SUB>j,m</SUB>.A<SUB>j</SUB> </I>....(2)

<P>where <I>P<SUB>j,m</SUB></I> are coefficients describing the contribution of atom 
<I>j</I> to linear combination <I>m</I>. Many of the coefficients <I>P<SUB>j,m</SUB></I> 
may turn out to be zero as we expect only those elements relevant to the 
particular mechanism to contribute to the composite vector.

<P>There will in general be several such mechanisms <I>m</I> for improving the 
yield stress, and so for improving agreement with the target. Each mechanism 
will depend on different linear combinations <I>P<SUB>j,m</SUB></I> of atomic 
concentrations. One may seek to evaluate in turn several such sets of combinations 
appropriate for different mechanisms m for increasing the target yield stress.

<P>The method used to derive the coefficients <I>P<SUB>j,m</SUB></I> in equation 2 
begins as in the forward sequential selection of features method, by finding 
that single chemical element, say C, whose addition to the network together with 
the fixed variables gives the greatest reduction in the test residual. 
At the same time all the potential atomic inputs are ordered according to the 
reduction in residual obtained when they are added to the network as in figure 5.

<P>The method is continued by considering, along with the most salient atomic input 
(in this case carbon) and the fixed inputs, the possible inclusion of all other 
remaining atomic variables. These are taken in the order of saliency so that 
nitrogen is taken first. The next step is to form a linear combination of the 
inputs from the most salient atomic variable C with those from the second most 
important N and to observe the trend of the test residual, as the fraction of 
the second atom is increased. The new variable is

<P><I>X<SUB>1</SUB> = (1-f) A<SUB>C</SUB> + fA<SUB>N</SUB></I> ...(3)

<P>where <I>f</I> is varied from 0 to 1 and <I>A<SUB>C</SUB></I> and 
<I>A<SUB>N</SUB></I> are the individual atomic inputs. Examples of such curves 
are given in figure 8.

<IMG SRC="chfig8.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<P><B><P>Figure 8: The test data residual when new linear combination inputs 
are used between the inputs.  The light triangles show the effect of adding a 
given fraction of the Silicon atomic input to the existing best component. 
The dark squares show the effect of adding the Chromium input to the previous 
best result obtained. The vertical lines indicate the standard deviations 
contributing to the average.</B>



<P>This process is continued until the inclusion of extra atomic components 
gives no further reduction in the residual. This is illustrated by the closed 
squares in figure 9. The steady reduction in the residual as more single 
atomic input variables are added is seen for 4 cycles. The atoms added to 
the combination are N, Co, V and Cr. The process continues until all atoms 
have been included in the linear combination and the best combination 
identified. After this point the inclusion of further atomic component 
inputs gives no further reduction in the residual. The inclusion of many 
atoms fails to reduce the residual.

<IMG SRC="chfig9.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
<P><B><P>Figure 9: The test data residual when linear combinations of atomic 
inputs are constructed compared with when single atomic inputs are added. 
It is seen that the combination inputs give lower residuals than the atomic inputs.  
The results are for test data at irradiation levels >20 dpa, and with 
networks with number of hidden units (shown as nh) giving the lowest residual.  </B>

<P>The next step is then to consider the addition of a further component. 
Again the remaining single atomic inputs are added to the fixed inputs and 
the first combination input. If a reduction in the test residual is found the 
atomic input giving the greatest reduction in the residual is chosen as 
the primary component. Linear combinations of this atomic input with others 
are then made as in the case of the first component. If significant 
reductions in the test residual are found then these atomic inputs are 
added to the component. The process of adding component inputs continues 
until the addition of further atomic inputs causes no further reduction 
in the residual. The improvement over single atomic inputs is shown in Figure 9.

<P>This process may be repeated for any number of hidden units and the 
best performance noted. The closed squares and solid line shown earlier in 
Figure 7 shows the hidden unit dependence for component inputs compared 
for single atom inputs. The generally lower minimum residuals shown by 
the target driven component method is clearly shown.

800 iterations and include the best 10 results from 20 runs. The open circles 
are an example of fitting to all the data using the leave-one-out method. 
The open squares are for the added atom method, the closed triangles for 
the target driven components method.</B>

<P><p><b>5. The prediction accuracy: scatter plots for various predictions</b>


<P>Figure 10 shows the conventional scatter plot of the predicted Charpy 
transition shift against the calculated shift for several different 
calculations and for test data above different irradiation levels. 
The small faint circles are for a leave-one-out analysis of the whole dataset, 
and are presented to give an indication of the fitting accuracy when all 
the data are included in training. The dark triangles are for test data 
above 20 dpa, and give the minimum residual achieved within a hidden units 
scan using the target-driven components method. The open squares are the 
best achieved using added atoms.

<P>The result, clear from figure 10, that the target-driven component method 
can produce excellent results was confirmed by running BIGBACK with inputs 
including both the fixed inputs and the linear combinations of atomic inputs 
derived from the MAGEOM runs. An example of the best results achieved by this 
method is shown in figure 11. Here the test data are for irradiations > 20 dpa. 
Interestingly the best results were obtained including the <I>T<SUB>irr</SUB></I> 
input but excluding the dpa irradiation level input. The best residual is 
seen to be 24.0 K, appreciably less than that in the run shown in figure 2 
which included all inputs and gave the residual 120.0 K. It is just slightly 
larger than the value 20.9 K given by the best target-driven component run.

<P><p><b>6. Metallurgical implications</B>

<P>Consider the case shown in the scatter plot of figure 10. Table 1 shows in 
numerical order the contributing atomic inputs. Generally there are up to around 
7 atomic inputs which contribute. The most important in almost every case is 
carbon (C), the chief carbide former. Chromium (Cr) frequently occurs as a 
former of carbide precipitates. Silicon (Si) occurs as a common deoxidant. 
Other atomic inputs occur only sporadically and their occurrence may not be 
statistically significant. In many case the target-driven components method 
produces similar contributing atoms. For example run 882, which resembles 
run 431, generates the following target-driven components: 
[0.028C, 0.019Co, 0.123V, 0.030Si, 0.800Cr] and [0.143B, 0.194Ti, 0.337Al, 0.325W]. 

<P><p><b>7. Conclusions</B>

<P>Good performance has been achieved in predicting the Charpy ductile-brittle 
transition temperature above a particular irradiation level (say >20 dpa) from a 
459 alloy database trained on data below this level.


<P>The irradiation temperature proved a critical input parameter. 
Better test performance was achieved when this input variable was excluded, 
although the training performance was worse.

<P>The best results were obtained using the target-driven components method, 
where linear combinations of the atomic inputs are chosen which achieve a 
minimal test residual.

<P>Both the MAGEOM and BIGBACK neural network codes gave good results 
for the prediction of high irradiation level properties.
