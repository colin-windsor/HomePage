Neutron diffraction measures stress through the small changes in atomic lattice parameters 
caused by strain. The method is similar to X-ray diffraction with the vital difference that 
a thermal neutron beam penetrates several centimetres in most materials allowing measurements 
within bulk samples. Ways of achieving the high resolution necessary for quantitative measurements 
are described. Results are presented for the strains in a mild steel bar subjected to known elastic 
stresses, and on the internal stresses in a deformed bar.


<B><P>Introduction</P></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times new Roman" SIZE=3>
The absolute measurement of internal stress within bulk components 
currently poses a major problem in the field of non-destructive testing 
as none of the existing methods provide unambiguous data<SUP>1</SUP>. For example 
ultrasonic methods measure lattice strain through its effect on the sound
 velocity, but this is also affected by preferred orientation
or texture in the sample <SUP>2</SUP>. X-ray diffraction measures strain
directly but can only measure essentially the surface strain
since, in the diffraction method, X-rays penetrate only a
few tens of microns into typical metals<SUP>3</SUP>. Many magnetic
measurements are functions of strain but none are functions of strain alone.

<P>The neutron diffraction method<SUP>4</SUP> measures strain directly
through changes in the lattice spacing as in X-ray diffraction,
and is essentially unaffected by other sample properties
such as texture. Because of the neutrons' ability to penetrate
inside bulk materials we believe it is likely to become an
important technique for internal stress measurement.
However its drawback is that high resolution is needed,
and neutron beams of sufficient intensity are only available
at reactors or accelerator-based neutron sources. Samples
may be transported to the neutron beam, but conventional
methods must still be used on the factory floor.

<P>In the following sections we outline the principles of the
neutron diffraction technique for measuring internal stress.
We then describe two different diffractometers with sufficient 
resolution to measure the internal strains in steels.
We then describe measurements on a 6 mm (1 in) mild
steel bar subjected to defined external stresses below its
elastic limit. Lastly we describe measurements of the
internal stress in a 25 mm (1 in) thick bar deformed beyond
its elastic limit.

Neutrons of a particular wavelength are selected from the reactor beam by reflection from a crystal

orientations which scatter at different angles
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>hkl</SUB> according to their

Neutron beams from reactors have a wavelength of the  
order of 0.1 nm (1 </span><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>&#506;</span>) - similar to that of an X-ray beam.       ,:
They differ from X-rays in interacting only weakly with  
matter and so penetrate several centimetres in most materials. 
A neutron beam monochromated to a particular wavelength
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span>
is diffracted by a polycrystalline material into a
series of cones as shown in Figure 1. The scattering angles
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>hkl</SUB> 
of these Debye Scherrer cones measure the lattice
spacings d^ of the various atomic planes with Miller
indices <I>hkl</I>. 
The scattering angles are related to the <I>d</i>
spacings through Bragg's law;
<P>
<P><I> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span> = 2d<SUB>hkl</SUB> 
sin(<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>hkl</SUB>/2)</I>.....(1)
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times new Roman" SIZE=3>
<P>An internal stress causes a strain which changes the lattice
spacings <I>d</i> by a tiny fraction 
<I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span>d/d</I>, of magnitude a few
times 10<SUP>-4</SUP>, which must be deduced from the consequential
changes <span style='font-family:Symbol'>Df</span> in scattering angles. 
Most conventional neutron
diffractometers have insufficient angular resolution to resolve
such small changes. The possible ways of improving the
sensitivity are made clear by differentiating Equation 1.
<P> <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d =
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>Dl</span>/
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span>  + 
cot<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span>/2 +  
(<span style='font-family:Symbol'>Df</span>/2)</I>   .....(2)
<P>
As the angle <span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> increases 
towards back scattering (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> = 180°)
 the term cot<span style='font-family:Symbol'>q</span> reduces to zero, 
and can therefore be made
 small with consequent improvement in resolution.
Alternatively the angular resolution <span style='font-family:Symbol'>Df</span> 
can be improved, for
example by defining the beam by multi-slit Soller collimators, 
but this results in a proportionate loss in intensity.
 In order to reduce the contribution of the <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>Dl</span>/
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span></I> term in
Equation 2, we consider the usual method of monochromating 
neutrons by Bragg reflection from a large single
crystal as in Figure 1. The wavelength is determined by the
monochromated beam angle <span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>M</SUB> 
and the spacing <I>d<SUB>M</SUB></I> of the
crystal planes held at the appropriate orientation. The
wavelength resolution term is then


<P> <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>Dl</span>/
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span> =
cot<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>M</SUB>/2 +  
(<span style='font-family:Symbol'>Df</span><SUB>M</SUB>/2)</I>   .....(3)
<P>

High resolution is obtained either by going to high angles
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>M</SUB> 
or by improved collimation. Of the two diffractometers 
we describe, one uses scattering angles within the
range 5° to 10° from back scattering in both 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>M</SUB> and 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>hkl</SUB>(j) to
obtain the necessary resolution without exceptional collimation. 
The other uses high angles of order 110° coupled
with high (10') collimation.

Figure 2 shows schematically a large, stressed, polycrystalline 
sample placed in the sample position of a 
neutron diffractometer. Of all the grains in the sample
only those whose lattice planes are oriented to allow Bragg
reflection will contribute to the scattered beam. Bragg
reflection occurs when the normal to the reflecting planes
bisects the incident and scattered neutron beams and is
therefore parallel to the change in neutron wave vector, 
conventionally denoted as the scattering vector <B>Q</B>. 
If the direction of the stress 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span>
in the sample lies along <B>Q</B>, (Q ||<span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span> ) 
the appropriate lattice spacings will be slightly increased. If it
lies perpendicular to it the same lattice spacings
will be slightly contracted because of the Poisson's ratio
effect in the bulk material acting on each crystallite.
By rotating the specimen in the diffractometer and
measuring the d spacing shift as a function of orientation,
the principal axes of the strain tensor can be determined.
(Shear strains giving the off-diagonal terms in the strain
tensor have different effects.) The stress can then be
calculated from the strain knowing the elastic moduli from
bulk measurements.

<P>Figure 2 also illustrates how a relatively thin incident and
scattered neutron beam can be used to define a precise
volume within a large bulk specimen and so measure stress
as a function of position over the specimen volume. The
volume is best defined when 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>hkl</SUB> is around 
90<SUP>o</SUP>, and least well defined in the back scattering geometry.

<P><FONT FACE="Times new Roman" SIZE=3>                   
Figure 3 shows the layout of the double back scattering
(DBS) diffractometer at Harwell with which residual stress
effects were first observed. The diffractometer was modified
from the MARX spectrometer on the PLUTO reactor. A
preliminary crystal monochromator of pyrolitic graphite
selects a roughly monochromatic beam of about 0.4 nm 
wavelength. Selection of a very narrow wavelength band is
then achieved by Bragg reflection from a single crystal of
pure iron aligned so as to reflect from its 110 planes at a
scattering angle  
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span><SUB>M</SUB>= 174.15° corresponding to 5.84° from
back scattering. An iron crystal was chosen since the use of
back scattering from both monochromator crystal and 
sample implies a match between the d-spacings <I>d<SUB>M</SUB></I> and
 <I>d<SUB>hkl</SUB></I> which is in practice only achieved by choosing the
 same plane of the same material. Iron or ferritic steel
 samples can then be placed in the beam reflected from
 the iron single crystal and the 110 powder reflection
 observed. Scattered neutrons are detected by a position-
 sensitive detector covering an angular range of about 3° to
 28°. No special collimation is used, but the size of an
 8-mm-wide beam between the iron single crystal and the
 sample gives a geometric collimation 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>a</span><SUB>1</SUB>~= 0.9°. The
 counter resolution of 6 mm together with an 8 mm wide
 sample gives a scattered beam geometric collimation
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>a</span><SUB>2</SUB> ~ 0.5°. 
The resolution calculated using Equations 2 and
 3 (and so neglecting any focussing<SUP>4</SUP> considerations) is then
 <span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d ~ 0.5 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP>. 
Collimation in the vertical plane is
determined by the heights of the iron single crystal,
sample and counter, all of which are about 40 mm. This
degree of vertical collimation gives a negligible contribution
to the resolution.

<P>
In fact all the samples of iron or steel investigated gave
widths appreciably larger than this calculated resolution.
Even a sample of iron powder, strain-annealed by heating
to 550°C for one hour, gave a width 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d ~ 1.5 x 10.
Our annealed steel bar 5 mm thick gave a width
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d ~1.8 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP>. 
Such widths can be due to microscopic
internal stresses within a single grain of the material, such
as those caused by dislocations or defects within the grain,
or from microscopic stresses varying randomly from grain
to grain produced by, say, an impurity phase. This micro-
scopic stress can be measured by diffraction only after
deconvolution of a term 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d ~
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span>/2L 
depending on the
size <I>L</I> of the diffracting crystallites. The macroscopic strain
spans several grains of a material and so gives a uniform
shift to the peak angle rather than a width. The minimum
detectable shift, which determines the minimum detectable
stress, is typically at least 1/10 of the width of the observed
peak. The actual value depends on the statistics of the
measurement and the degree to which the line-shape is
      well-defined.

resolution 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d ~ 1.4 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> at 109° 
is achieved by relatively high
monochromator and scattering angles, by multislit Soller collimators

The powder diffractometer D1A is situated on a thermal
      guide tube from the high-flux reactor at the Institut Laue-
      Langevin at Grenoble. It was already noted for its high
     resolution<SUP>5</SUP>. Its layout is shown in Figure 4. The guide tube
      gives an effective collimation 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>a</span><SUB>0</SUB>= 0.25° for 0.19 nm
      neutrons. This is convoluted with the mosaic spread of the
      germanium monochromator to give a beam on the sample
      with angular divergence 0.67°. Scattered neutrons are
      selected by ten Soller collimators of divergence 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>a</span><SUB>2</SUB>= 0.17°,
     each in front of a counter separated by 6°. This configuration
     gave a resolution at 

<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> = 109° of 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d = 1.6 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> as
     measured from a strain-free alumina specimen. The resolution 
was further improved by the addition of a further
      Soller collimator giving a divergence between the mono-
      chromator and sample 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span>=0.17°. This increased the
     measured resolution at <span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span>= 109° to 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d = 1.39 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP>M/d, 
     marginally less than the resolution calculated using Equations 2 and 3 
because, near this scattering angle, focussing
     effects are appreciable. With this diffractometer, scans must
     be made by changing the scattering angle 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> in small steps.
     We concentrated most measurements on the iron 311 powder
     peak as this came near <span style='font-family:Symbol'>f</span> = 109°, 
allowing focussing effects
     to be exploited in improving the resolution. Only one
     counter could be used effectively for the scan. The counters
     6° on either side were used to estimate a background, although
     this was typically only a percent or two of the peak.

<P><FONT FACE="Times new Roman" SIZE=3>                   
     As a test of the method, an extensive series of measure-
     ments was performed on a bar of low-carbon mild steel
     which could be deformed to a known degree below its limit
     of elasticity. The bar had a thickness t=6 mm (1/4 in) and
     width w = 51 mm (2 in) and had been heat treated for one
     hour at 550°C to remove residual stresses. (The first measurements 
were performed on a similar bar of just half the
     thickness and width.)
     The strain was applied as shown in Figure 5. One end was
     firmly clamped, while the other end could be displaced by
     distances z by rotation of a vice screw.

 The length of the bar between the clamp end and the top
 of the vice was l = 214 mm. It had been hoped to measure
 the stress directly from the displacement <I>z</I>. The stress
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span>(x, y) at a position <I>x</I> 
from the clamp and <I>y</I> from the
 neutral axis would then be given in terms of Young's modulus
 <I>E</I> by

Scans of the counts recorded by the position-sensitive
 detector as a function of the detector gate number. One gate
 corresponds to a 1.6 mm displacement and to 0.06° in scattering
 angle. The different curves correspond to 0, 1/4, 1/3, and 3/4 turns of the
 screw thread of the vice
<P><FONT FACE="Times new Roman" SIZE=3>                   
Profile measurements were performed by mounting the bar
horizontally on a plane table and traversing a height gauge
over the top surface of the bar. Although the height accuracy 
was better than 10<SUP>-2</SUP> mm, the need to differentiate
twice led to an appreciable possible error in the calibration
of stress of perhaps 30%. The maximum stress occurs on
the edge of the bar (y = w/2) and near the clamped end
(x = 0). Taking Young's modulus for steel as E = 207 x 10<SUP>9</SUP> Pa
(30 x 10<SUP>6</SUP> lbf/in<SUP>2</SUP>) gave a maximum stress at our largest
nominal displacement of 137 MPa. This is not far below
the yield stress 250 MPa. In fact our smaller bar emerged
from any further displacement with a permanent set at the
clamped end. No observable deviations from elastic behaviour 
occurred in our larger bar.
 Figure 6 shows experimental results made using the
 Harwell DBS diffractometer. The curves are plotted against
 channel number of the position-sensitive detector as a
 function of the nominal applied stress in turns of the vice
 screw. For these data the bar was aligned vertically so that

      the normal to the Bragg reflecting planes was perpendicular
      to the stress. The actual displacement of the bar was only a
      few millimetres and, being along the back scattering direction, 
produced no significant effect on the scattering angle.
   The displacement due to stress is clearly seen and was
      evaluated from the centroid of the peak profile together
     with its statistical error. The shifts relative to the unstressed
      position were converted into a relative shift 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d
 in lattice
     spacing using Equation 1. The circled points in Figure 7
      are these values plotted against the stress calculated for this
     region of the bar using Equation 5. The shift is a negative
     one as expected for the Q i a geometry of Figure 2.
     Using the D1A diffractometer it was possible to orient the
     bar so that reflecting planes with normals Q either parallel
     or perpendicular to the stress direction a could be observed.
     Examples of the data for Q perpendicular to 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span> are shown in Figure 8. The
     actual linewidth corresponds to 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d ~ 2.3 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and is
     appreciably larger than the resolution of 1.4 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP>. The
     lineshape is seen to be close to Gaussian. The peak position
     was deduced from a least squares fit of the data to a
     Gaussian of variable intensity and width. The total run
     time for a scan on both diffractometers was about 10
     minutes.
     The uncircled points in Figure 7 shows the shifts 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>d/d from
     the D1A data plotted against the stress 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>s</span>(x, y) averaged
  over an 8-mm-wide strip near the edge of the bar (x = 30 mm,
     y = 48 mm). The upper points correspond to the
 Q parallel to the stress
     configuration and show positive shifts with a magnitude
about three times as great as the lower points which have negative
shifts measured in the <B>Q</B> perpendicular to 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>d</span> configuration.
The cental scale to Figure 7 shows the macroscopic strain

calculated from the curvature measured at the experimental points. The upper
line has a slope of unity showing that the macroscopic extension is roughly equal to
the microscopic extension as measured from the lattice spacings.
The lower line has a slope of -0.30. This shows that the microscopic Poisson's ratio
is again roughly equal to the macroscopic Poisson's ratio for steel of 0.30.

A second series of measurements was made on a mild steel
bar of 25 mm (1 in) thickness, and 51 mm (2 in) width which
had been subjected to sufficient stress to bend it beyond its
elastic limit into a permanent curve of radius about 500 mm
across the 51 mm width. It therefore contained large residual
strains up to and beyond the elastic limit. It was placed on
the D1A diffractometer with the reflecting planes along the
bar. The magnitude of the stress across the width of the bar
was measured by raising the bar across the incident beam
narrowed by slits to 7 mm height. The results are shown in
Figure 9. They have been converted into stresses from the
calibration curve given by the slope of the upper line in
Figure 7. The bar clearly contains an elastically deformed
central region although the neutral axis does not coincide
exactly with the bar axis. The outer regions contain the
plastically deformed metal.

for a position 13 mm from the strained edge of
the bar by performing scans as a function of the angle o

strain direction to lie along the bar to

High-resolution neutron diffraction gives a measure of
internal stress within bulk materials of up to several
centimetres thickness which can be calibrated absolutely
and is not affected by texture or sample surface. Measurements 
take about 10 minutes on the two diffractometers described. 
However, the method is restricted to samples
that can be taken to a neutron source of reasonably high
flux. The sensitivity for samples free of microscopic strain
is as high as a few percent of the elastic limit strain, but this
sensitivity is reduced for samples whose microscopic strain
is large.
