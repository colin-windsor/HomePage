<P><B> Stainer and the Crucifixion</B>
<BR>Stainer was born in London in 1840 and was a Chorister at St Pauls at age 10.
<BR>Aged 14 he sung in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion.
<BR>Aged 20 he became organist at my Magdalen College, Oxford. He rejuvenated the choir with exciting new music,including many new compositions, among them our family favourite "I Saw the Lord".
<BR>He was an outstanding organ player and was soon appointed as University Organist, playing for the University Church. 

<BR>Aged 22, and married with 5 children he returned to St Pauls as organist. Soon W Sparrow Simpson was Precentor

<P>Stainer's Crucifixion was first performed on 24 February 1887 at St Marylebone Parish Church.
Easier to sing than Bach's passions, it was designed to be sung by parish church choirs. 
The text by W Sparrow Simpson is based on the King James bible with some additions.
