<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
Ground penetrating RADAR has
become an important tool in anti-personnel mine detection. In general a buried
object can be detected by scanning the ground surface with the radar probe. An
object whose size is comparable with a typical wavelength (0.1m @ 1 GHz) gives
rise to a complex reflection pattern consisting of a superposition of inverted
hyperbolic arcs in three dimensions (3-D). Previous papers have described the
codes which use the gradient information in the scattering data to replace each
overlapping arc by an &quot;apex point&quot; describing the 3-D position,
amplitude and sign of each arc. This paper introduces the concept of a
&quot;pendant&quot;: a series of reflections whose apexes lie close to a
vertical column which may be identified as arising from a single object. The
amplitudes of these reflections may be used a features for object
classification. The method is demonstrated using radar images from a buried
isolated mine and also in proximity with other objects. The aim of this
classification scheme is the identification of one object (mine) type against
more &quot;point-like&quot; signals from &quot;clutter&quot; objects small compared to the
wavelength.</p></I>

A scanned ground penetrating
RADAR beam gives rise to a complex 3-D pattern of scattered intensity when
reflected by a buried object. While there has been much work on the detection
and location of buried objects <sup>(1)(2)(3)</sup>, it would be highly
desirable to be able to distinguish the mines from the welter of other benign
buried objects that can give a significant reflected intensity. A problem is
that human interpretation is difficult because of the large quantity of
information that needs to be displayed. This classification problem has been
already tacled with several techniques by other authors <sup>(4)(5)(6)</sup>.
For example a mine buried 10 cm deep in sand and scanned using a 2 cm raster
may show signals over 20 cm in both directions. Neither a single plot of range
along a scan (B-scan) nor signal amplitude at a given range (C-scan) provide
more than a fraction of the useful information available in 3-D.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Classification is possible because of the
relatively large size of most mines compared to the wavelength, and compared to
the size of many other strongly reflecting objects. The incident RADAR pulse
usually contains a wavelet with only a couple of maxima, but the reflected
pulse from a mine is composed of a superposition of reflections from the
various mine interfaces, including some multiple reflections, and is likely to
contain at several maxima whose relative intensities are characteristic of the
particular mine.

<p>Figure 1 shows how the data
used in this paper were obtained at the LAMI-DETEC institute<sup>(7)</sup>. The
1 GHz source was scanned over a box 1.5 m deep and filled with sand or earth.
Typical values for the central wavelength at 1 GHz in an average soil is 10 cm.
Various objects were placed in the box at known positions and depths.
Raster scans were performed with the
reflected intensity as a function of time, being recorded along a 1 m long path
along the X-direction. The position of the antenna in contact with the ground
was then stepped by 2 cm in the Y direction, perpendicular to the original
scan. In this way a series of acquisitions along parallel planes are devised
and this form a 3-D data set, as shown in Figure 2.</p>


<p>An example of typical B-scan containing reflections from a mine buried in sand 
is also shown in figure 2. The strong black flat reflection at the top is the 
&quot;main bang&quot; indicating the reflection from the surface of the sand. Its range 
can be used to calibrate the depth. The mine shows up as a series of inverted 
hyperbolic arcs, whose apex defines the lateral position of the mine along the scan, 
and whose range defines both the depth and the vertical extent of the mine. 
Regarding the alternation of the signal maxima and minima, 
Figure 3 illustrates the way the composite signal shown in figure 2 at each 
probe position, might be constructed from the various planar interfaces of 
the mine and perpendicular to the probe vertical axis. Reflections from the 
upper and lower surfaces occur with various defined amplitudes and phases 
according to the dielectric properties of the materials. In addition there 
may be significant multiple reflections. The summation of all these signals 
gives rise to a complex waveform containing several "ripples". The separation 
of the peaks is roughly constant being determined by the wavelength. 
Their amplitude and phase is characteristic of the structure of the mine(8). 
A small but strongly scattering object, such a piece of scrapnel a few 
centimetres across, gives a reflected signal whose profile is much more like 
the incident wave, and so is easily distinguished.</p>

<p>The new approach pursued in this work for the classification of buried object is the notion of
tridimensional contrast pattern derived from the acquisition of 3-D data. This contrast pattern is generated
in the most simple case of a point-like object buried at position (x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>,
z<sub>0</sub>), by the amplitudes of the scattered signals at different times
of flight (TOF) gathered at surface positions (x,y, 0) with a Radar probe:</P

<p>TOF= 2*[(x-x<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
+(y-y<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> +z<sub>o</sub><sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup>/V </p>
<p>where V is the propagation velocity of the medium.</p>
<p>The range can be easily
derived from the previous TOF equation by assuming V constant, which is true
for a homogeneous medium. The contrast patterns appear as stacked hyperbolic
functions in the x,y,TOF representation due to the alternations of positive and
negative peaks of the scattered signals. The proposed algorithm is aimed to
extract the hyperbolic contrast patterns from the 3-D data set that will be
used to retrieve essential buried object characteristics from their spatial
position, morphology and phase information. The exploitation of this concept
will be described in the next sections. However this task is not trivial
considering the following experimental conditions:</P>
<p>1.	Limited spatial and bandwidth of the Radar</p>
<p>2.	Poor approximation of point-like object</p>
<p>3.	Clutter (surrounding debris)</p>
<p>4.	Inhomogeneous medium</p>
<p>Regarding the difficult problem of clutter reduction we decided to design 
an algorithm composed of several successive steps in order to reduce progressively 
the problem complexity and to enhance the object characteristic response. 
The problem of automatic hyperbolic arc extraction has been studied for 
two-dimensional images and the results obtained with different techniques 
on simulated and real images have been published.<sup>(3)(9)(10)</sup></p>

<P>The processing scheme applied
to the available data starts with the background removal, which consists in the
application of a standard linear high-pass filter along the scanning direction.
The typical effect is the cancellation from the image of the high level pulse
reflected at the air to ground interface which increases the grey levels
dynamic for the useful signals (see example in Figure 2). The second processing
step is the gradient calculation to define the image contrast. The hyperbolic
patterns are originated from ringing signals and they can be precisely defined
by calculating the vector gradient using the intensity level <i>f(x,y,z=const)</i>
Local properties of the 3-D image <i>f(x,y,z)</i> are retained and the morphological
information of the buried object response are estimated by the 3-D gradient. We
found this approach more robust than other methods based on signal amplitudes.
The image contrast<i> </i>is defined by the 3-D gradient </p>

<p><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>f(x,y,z)=(df/dx,df/dy,df/dz).</p>

<p>The partial derivatives
have been calculated using the central finite differences method. The
calculation of the gradient over a mesh provides a vector field that can be
used to estimate the flux lines. The flux lines describe the ridges of the
hyperbolic patterns that can be calculated by exploiting the change in the sign
of the gradient corresponding to local maximum or minimum. For example the
change of the gradient sign can be determined by the convolution of the
gradient with a function Q<sub>T</sub> defined as: </p>

<p> GS[f(t)] = sign[f'(t) x Q<sub>T</sub>(t) where Q<sub>T</sub>(t) = 1 if t betweem 0 and T/2 </P>
<p> = -1 of t between -T/2 and 0 and  = 0 elsewhere</p>

<p>where T is the period corresponding to the Radar pulse central frequency and t is a parameter that indicate a
position along a flux line.</p>

<p>For a better understanding of how a typical contrast pattern looks like, Figure 4
shows the first three contrast patterns found on a PFM mine scan: the first and
the third pattern are obtained by the negative phase waves and the second one
with the positive phase waves.</p>                                                                               </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>The next step is the classification of these patterns by assigning to the points
belonging to the same pattern a code number and an associated colour. A colour
bar with number codes will be printed together with the final visualization of
results for object identification. Finally for data reduction only the set of
points with cardinality higher than a predefined threshold are stored.<p>

<p>The final processing before the visualization is the transformation of extracted
points from the variable space (x,y,TOF) into real space hyperboloid centres 
(x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>,z<sub>0</sub>)
defining a buried object position. This process employs a modified version of

three unknowns (x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>,z<sub>0</sub>) and it calculates a
possible hyperboloid position. This position is accumulated and the inversion
process repeated many times until all the points of the patterns are
considered. The same process is applied for all extracted patterns. Each
estimated position is affected by an error due to the uncertainty of the
measurements (E<sub>x</sub>, E<sub>y</sub>, E<sub>TOF</sub>); this means that
all the accumulated positions are scattered around the nominal object position
(x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>,z<sub>0</sub>), according to the equivalence
between depth (z) and time of flight (TOF). Then patterns with many points that
are well correlated with a hyperboloid function provide high scores and low
variance. Their representation in 3-D is a sphere having a radius proportional
to the score and three segments proportional to the variances

distribution, provides an immediate indication to the user of the reliability
and uncertainty of the object position estimation.</P>
<p>The above method has been tested also with some extended objects (size comparable
to few wavelengths) and it has been assumed an object scattering model
consisting of a distribution of point-like scatterers on the object surface. In
particular it has been also verified that contours of sharp objects can also be
detected because their points give rise to a hyperbolic-like functions. A
mathematical model is under study to consider the relative contrast patterns as
an extension of the objects contours according to the hyperbolic transformation
provided by the above equation for TOF. </p>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>3. The sorting of apex points into &quot;pendants&quot</P></B></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><p>
The apex points located during scan over a mine will generally look as in figure 5.
The mine itself, being relatively large in the scale of the wavelength, will
generally give a series of apexes of opposite sign extending downwards in
depth. The smaller &quot;debris&quot; objects will generally be described by
just one or two apexes, while larger benign objects such as a coke bottle, may
again show several apexes.</p>

</span>All spheres are projected on the xy, yz, zx planes. On the right the
palette shows the map of set’s code versus sphere colour..</p></I></font>
<p>The set of apex points generated from 
the reflections from a single buried object will generally satisfy all of the 
following conditions.</p>
<p> 1. They fall into a vertical column above each other within a specified distance
tolerance <FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>x=<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>y of say 0.06 m </p>
<p> 2. The vertical spacing between points should fall, within a specified tolerance 
<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>z, of a constant distance equal to half the wavelength
<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>l</font> within the medium. Typically <FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>z
is say 0.015 m for a wavelength of around 0.1 m</p>
<p> 3. "White" high phase apex points must alternate
with "black" low phase points</p>
<p> The phase of each part of the reflection is a key variable in its use for pendant
location. Since the main bang in this series of measurements was "white", the
extraction was started by searching for the most intense white apex point
within the image. If the weight of this reflection lay above a specified
threshold, the point was confirmed as the start of a potential pendant series.
A search over all "black" points in the image was then made, at deeper depths
for points present within the allowed volume defined by the current values of 
<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>x, <FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>y,
<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>z and <FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>l</font>. 
These volumes are denoted by the small rectangles in figure 6. The
optimal value of <FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>l</font> was later 
refined by evaluating a running total of the accepted
vertical spacings. Generally only one point in the image satisfied the
criteria. However in case more than one point was within the allowed volume,
the one whose distance was closest to the predicted position was taken. If at
least one point was found the extraction continued, but with the phase of the
search changed to look for the next deeper white point. If no point was found
within the currently specified volume, the search still deeper was abandoned.
The extraction then continued from the original most intense point, but to more
shallow depths. The volume definition parameters used were
<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>x=0.015m, <FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>y=0.015m,
<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>D</font>z=0.015m and <FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>l</font>/2=0.045m.</p>

<p>Many of the noise reflections gave only a single point in the pendant series,
corresponding to an object small compared to the wavelength. However several of
the reflections gave rise to a series of up to 5 apex points of alternating
sign. The weights of each point of the series have been divided by their
average weight so that the patterns are unaffected by absolute changes in
contrast. The first white point is generally the largest, and is often preceded
by a single black point and followed by a black, a white, and sometimes a
further black point. Five feature parameters were therefore chosen for
classification in this study. They were the weights of the leading black,
principal white, next black, next white and next black, divided by their
average weight.</p>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>4. The training and test data used to classify mines
from other objects</P></B></FONT>

<p>The data at our disposal consisted of scans over PMN mines at varying depths in
sand and in earth, and a test scan containing a PMA mine, a metal ring and a
bottle, all giving relatively intense signals compared with the noise
level.The two mimicking landmines used
in the laboratory<sup>(7)</sup> are very similar and they have the following
characteristics: PMA-3 cylindrical mine with diameter 10 mm, height 50 mm, RTV
filled; PMN diameter 112 mm, height 56
mm. PMN mine half filled with the replacing silicon. There were four scans over
sand, with a PMN mine at depth 1, 3, 5, and 10 cm. In these cases the PMN mine
being the only significant object in each scan and all gave clear pendants. The
three scans over earth had the mine at 3, 5 and 10cm depth. The mine signal was
always clear but in earth it was together with other several smaller signals
that could also be classified as noise objects. All the mines gave good
pendants similar to that in figure 6. These 7 scans over mines formed the basis
of the training data. The quality of the data can be seen from the first seven
(solid line) traces in figure 7 which show the five normalised feature
parameters for the mine pendants at different depths in sand and earth.</p>

<p>The test data consisted of a set of scans over an earth tray containing several
objects. One was a PMA mine, one a ring of metal, and one a bottle. All these
objects gave strong signal, and there were in addition several smaller signals
from stones and other objects present in the earth.<span style="mso-spacerun:

the amplitude of the feature, and the grey and black colours the positive and
negative phases. A pendant with 4 features is seen from the mine, the metal
ring has only 3 features and the bottle only one.</p>

<p>A surface view over the area of figure 8 is shown in figure 9. This
representation makes clear how close to the vertical are the apexes of the
reflections from the objects. In fact the separation of the three objects is
shown to be much better than might have been estimated from the perspective
