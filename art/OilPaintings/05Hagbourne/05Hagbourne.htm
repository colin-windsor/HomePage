<IMG alt="The oil painting of Hagbourne in our French house" SRC="05Hagbourne.jpg"</A>
<P>This painting was done during a glorious sunny spell in May 2005 on the seat just outside our present allotment in the centre of East Hagboune. It is now in the lounge of our French house.
It shows all my family. On the left are Elizabeth and Jane along with Margarets dog Bigsy, with Margaret behind, On the bicycle is Mo, and on the right is Jonathan and my mother Ray with Jonathan's dog.
