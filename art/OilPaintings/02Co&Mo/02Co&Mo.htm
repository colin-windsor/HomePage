<P>Colin and Mo did this painting together, each painting the other. It was done in the tiny 3<SUP>rd</SUP> bedroom at 12 Kew Win and includes the lovey view from the window. It started off with the line drawing seen below.
<P>This drawing of Mo developed into the prototype of the circular arc algorithm which Colin patented for face recognition. It was shown in several talks that Colin gave on neutral networks.
