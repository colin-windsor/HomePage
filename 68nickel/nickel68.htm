<P>        We have calculated the generalized susceptibility 
              <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT>(<B>K</B>,<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>)</I> of paramagnetic nickel at
              <I>1.67T<SUB>c</SUB></I> using a simple five-3d-band model in tight-binding approximation and compared
              it with neutron-scattering measurements. The only adjustable parameter was the exchange enhancement, 
              considered to arise from an effective Coulomb interaction <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB><B>(r</B>)</I>
              in the random-phase approximation. Our analysis is consistent with the interaction being dominated by the 
              on-site term at <I>r=0</I>, the relative contribution from any one nearest-neighbor 
              position coming to less than 10%.

<P> 
     Neutron-scattering data for paramagnetic nickel have recently become available,<SUP>1,2</SUP> surveying
the magnetic cross section as a function of energy transfer 
<I>h<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>/2<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT></I> 
and momentum transfer 
<I>h<B>K</B>/2<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT></I>
up to  about 1/8 eV throughout the first Brillouin zone in just sufficient detail to allow comparisons to be
made with theory.<SUP>3,4</SUP> Recently, Lowde and Windsor <SUP>5,6</SUP> gave an analysis of the results at 
<I>1.67T<SUB>c</SUB></I>  in terms of free-electron gas theory and found that  an absolute fit could be obtained if a 
random-phase approximation (RPA) enhancement of  3 ± 1 were applied to the theoretical susceptibility,
the parameters of the best-fitting gas then being in good agreement with what is estimated from other arguments. 
Comparison with a free gas,  however, could be made only for <I>K</I>'s up to about  <I>1/2K<SUB>max</SUB></I>,  since 
the periodicity of the crystal gives rise to umklapp processes which have a
pronounced effect on the scattering at larger <I>K</I>'s  but which are not allowed for in the free-gas calculation.


<P>  Clearly it would be desirable to compare these  data with high-quality calculations representing the various 
theoretical treatments of magnetism in metals. As an intermediate step we have per formed a simple tight-binding 
computation of the  generalized susceptibility. Such an elementary  expedient lacks a number of the refinements that
could, technically, be incorporated with a greater effort; but it does make proper allowance for  crystal periodicity 
and for the band multiplicity,  and it calls for comparison with the whole set of  data. In fact, a surprisingly good fit 
to the data  is obtained, with approximately the same RPA  enhancement factor as derived before.

<P>   We first computed the imaginary part
<P><IMG SRC="ni68eq1.jpg"> (1)</P>
<P>of the Lindhard susceptibility expression, the <I>f</I>'s  being temperature-dependent Fermi-Dirac occupation 
factors and the sum running over the  Brillouin zone of electron wave vectors <I><B>k,k'</B></I> and all five values of each 
band index <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">m, n</FONT></I>. The real part was then derived from (1) using the 
Kramers-Kronig relation, the integral in that relation being extended over the complete range for  which 
Im<I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT></i> is nonzero.  

<P>In the approximation of extremely tight binding,  where overlap 
of neighboring atomic wave functions is ignored, the matrix element 
<I>M<SUB>kk'</SUB><SUP><FONT FACE="Symbol">nm</FONT></SUP></I> can  be written
<P><IMG SRC="ni68eq2.jpg"> (2)</P>
<P>where <I><B>G</B></I> is an umklapp vector and the <I>c</I>'s are  the coefficients of the 3d orbitals (p in the 
one-electron wave functions
<P><IMG SRC="ni68eq3.jpg"> (3)</P>
<P> We assumed that the integral in (2) may be approximated by the atomic form factor 
<I>F(<B>K</B>)</I>;  thereupon its independence of <I>i</I> and <I>j</I> allowed us  to write
<P><IMG SRC="ni68eq4.jpg"> (4)</P>
<P>with <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT>'</I> the reduced susceptibility of Izuyama,  Kim, and Kubo,<SUP>7</SUP> 
and to concentrate attention on  calculating <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT>'</I> from the <I>c</I>'s and <I>E</I>'s.

<P>   The coefficients <I>c<SUB>i</SUB><SUP><FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT></SUP>(<B>k</B>)</I> and the one-electron 
energies  <I>E<SUB>k</SUB><SUP><FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT></SUP></I> were determined using the 
procedure given by Fletcher,<SUP>8</SUP> employing the integrals  (over the Hartree-and-Hartree 1936 wave functions for 
Cu<SUP>+</SUP> of his Eq, (18) after multiplication  with the factor <FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT>/2 by which they were 
in error.<SUP>9</SUP>  The Fermi surface and density of states obtained  for nickel in, this way have recently been 
re-examined by Allan<SUP>10</SUP> and found to reproduce, albeit  roughly, many of the features of the more sophisticated 
theories; for instance, the density of  states at the paramagnetic Fermi surface at absolute zero comes to 
2.5 eV<SUP>-1</SUP>atom<SUP>-1</SUP> (spin  state)<SUP>-1</SUP>  as against a preferred 2.1, and the total  d-band width 
is 4.2 eV as against a preferred  4.5. Summation over the Brillouin zone in (1)  was performed for the 356 points of a mesh of
spacing <I>k<SUB>max</SUB></I>/14 that fall into the fundamental 1/48, and an energy histogram was constructed  to a base 
unit of 0.02 eV showing the susceptibility as a function of 
<I>h<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>/2<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT></I>.

<P>  Figure 1 shows both real and imaginary parts  of the unenhanced, reduced, tight-binding susceptibility at 1020°K for three 
of the 14 selected  values of K along the <100> direction. Where the comparison with a free-electron gas  is meaningful, i.e., the 
central part of the zone, the  results are very strikingly similar to those for a free gas. The limiting lines of our 
<I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT>'</I> at small <I>K</I> and <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT></I>
are those-of a free gas of <I>K<SUB>eff</SUB></I>= 1.3 ±0.1 <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>&#506;</span><sup>
<span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>-1</span></sup> and 
<I>E<SUB>F</SUB></I>= 0.37 ±0.03 eV, which are almost exactly the free-gas values giving the best fit of
Lowde and Windsor to the experimental data.

<P><FONT SIZE=3>  FIG. 1. The reduced susceptibility  
<I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT><SUB>non</SUB>'(<B>K</B>,<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>)</I>at
   1020°K  for a metal having no exchange enhancement and the constants of paramagnetic nickel as calculated  to 
tight-binding approximation for the five 3d bands only.</FONT>

<P> It may be assumed that the true <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT>'</I> is a smooth function on a scale of detail of the 
order 0.05 eV, and that the small-scale irregularities in Fig. 1 are caused by the coarseness of our mesh in reciprocal space. 
In the first place, at any given <I><B>K</B></I> the factor 
<I>f<SUB>k'</SUB><SUP><FONT FACE="Symbol">n</FONT></SUP>-
     f<SUB>k</SUB><SUP><FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT></SUP></I> averages the matrix element very extensively over 
the occupied volume of the zone, thus diminishing the influence of any local peculiarities in 
<I>E(<B>K</B></I>.  Moreover,<SUP>3</SUP> the susceptibility of a metal at an elevated temperature is effectively a 
weighted mean of the susceptibilities  <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT><SUB>E</SUB></I> at 0°K of models having the
bands filled to an energy <I>E</I>:
<P><IMG SRC="ni68eq5.jpg">(5)</P>
so at the high temperature of 0.088 eV<I>/K<sub>B</sub></I> employed in the present investigation such a wide compass of 
Fermi surfaces is brought into play that there is extremely little scope for detail to appear on a scale much finer than 
<I>K<sub>B</sub>T</i>.

<p>  Our expectation that the theoretical structure of the high-temperature susceptibility is such as to minimize its dependence 
on fine detail in <I>E(<B>k</B>)</I> is borne out by the fact that the neutron-scattering data show a gently varying function and that no 
anisotropy was observed within the error of measurement. Indeed, since anisotropy was not detected, we have regarded it 
as sufficient in the first instance to calculate 
 <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT>'</I> for the one direction of <I><B>K</B></i> only (the <100> direction), and for comparison 
purposes we collapse all the experimental data on to a single parameter <I><B>|K|</B></i> to improve the statistics.

<P>   The power spectrum <I>S(<B>K</B>,<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>)</I> of the spin fluctuations in paramagnetic 
nickel, derived from the neutron-scattering cross section via
<P><IMG SRC="ni68eq6.jpg">(6)</P>

<P>[in conventional notation, where again we extract |<I>F(<B>K</B>)</i>|<SUP>2</SUP>  from <I>S</I> in the interests 
of simplicity], is  related to the reduced susceptibility by
<P><IMG SRC="ni68eq7.jpg">(7)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3> FIG. 2. An absolute comparison between the power spectrum 
<I>S(<B>K</B>,<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>)</I>  of spin fluctuations in nickel at 1020°K as
observed by neutron scattering and as calculated from the tight-binding model of Fig. 1. Dotted lines denote no 
enhancement of the susceptibility; solid lines denote the assumption of an effective Coulomb interaction 
<I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I>=0.52 eV; dashed lines denote the effect of using 
<I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I>=0.32 eV. .</FONT>


<P>Our theoretical unenhanced <I>S</I> is illustrated by the dotted line in Fig. 2 and is seen to be in severe disagreement 
with the data. However, according to Izuyama, Kim, and Kubo <SUP>7</SUP> the effect in RPA of a Coulomb repulsion term 
in the Hamiltonian is to enhance <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT>'</I> as it were by a molecular field, and it is not 
difficult to show that with the most general RPA the molecular-field constant is the Fourier transform 
<I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I> 
of the effective Coulomb repulsion integral <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>r</B>)</I>. Then
<P><IMG SRC="ni68eq8.jpg">(8)</P>
<P>and hence<SUP>4</SUP>
<P><IMG SRC="ni68eq9.jpg">(9)</P>

<P>Using <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I>=0.52 eV, independent of K, a considerably more realistic function is obtained 
as demonstrated by the solid lines in Fig. 2. Bearing in mind that the calculation is absolute except for the adjustment of a 
constant <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I> the general tendency of the solid lines to follow the data throughout the zone 
is remarkable.

<P>  Further study of the situation shows that the best-fitting solid lines in all cases fall below the data at the larger energies. 
The more obvious weaknesses of our calculation would not be capable of producing this effect, and so if it is not just a 
defect of the data, the question arises whether it has a deeper significance. We wondered, in fact, whether it might not be 
wrong to explain the extra susceptibility observed over and above the unenhanced <I>d</I>-spin contribution simply by 
invoking an enhancement factor. Conceivably the explanation might be that there are other contributions to the susceptibility
from <I>s</I> electrons and from the orbital moment, for instance. By way of an attempt to explore this possibility, without 
having a quantitative estimate to support it, we have tried the effect of arbitrarily doubling the 
<I>3d<FONT FACE="Symbol">c</FONT><SUB>non</SUB>'</I>  and employing a lesser enhancement factor than before. 
The use of a constant <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I>=0.32 eV then produces the markedly improved fit exhibited by 
the broken lines.

<P>Both the calculations with enhancement shown in Fig. 2 give a notable degree of fit with a constant 
<I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I>=0.52 eV. In the latter case (with the arbitrary factor of 2) the function derived is 
realistic enough to allow fitting to be performed at the different <I>K</I>'s individually. The resulting 
<I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I>=0.52 eV is shown in Fig. 3, and within the uncertainty of the work is constant at 0.33± 0.03 eV.

<P><IMG SRC="ni68f3.jpg"></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>  FIG. 3. <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I> the Fourier transform of the effective Coulomb interaction
<I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>r</B>) for nickel at 1.67<I>T<SUB>c</SUB></I></FONT></I>. 

 <p>A corresponding set of fits with the completely absolute calculation corresponding to the solid lines in Fig. 2 can be 
made only if the data for 
<I>h<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT>/2<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT></I> 0.05eV are ignored on the assumption 
that the discrepancy at higher energies may be disregarded for some unknown reason. We cannot justify abandoning 
the higher energy measurements, but it is reassuring to note that if the absolute calculation be fitted where it can be, 
below 0.05 eV, an equally nearly constant <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I> is obtained of mean value 0.52± 0.04 eV. 
The reason is that the <i>K</i> dependence of the enhancement is much more pronounced at low energies; the two fits, 
taken together, suggest that the observed virtual independence of  <i>K</i> is a feature of the work not particularly 
sensitive to the detailed explanation assumed.

<P  If this near constancy of the observed  <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>k</B>)</I> be taken at its face value, accepting 
uncritically for the moment that an estimate of <I>S</I> from an unhybridized tight-binding model can be relied 
upon to this degree, it would follow that the Fourier transform <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB>(<B>r</B>)</i>  is close to 
a delta function in form.  This is in accordance with the long-familiar view that intra-atomic Coulomb repulsion is 
the dominant factor determining ferromagnetism in  nickel. Assuming there is no contribution from  the atoms beyond 
the nearest-neighbor positions,  Fig. 3 would suggest that any one of the 12 nearest neighbors to a nickel atom 
contributes less  than 10% of the on-site term at r=0 to the "effective Coulomb integral" if the contribution is  of the 
same sign, and less than 5% if the contribution is of the opposite sign. Both these limits  are materially lower than 
the ~30% contribution estimated by Clogston<SUP>11</SUP> for nearest neighbors in palladium.

<P>  The latter value 0.52 ± 0.04 eV for  <I>I<SUB>eff</SUB></I> corresponds to a susceptibility-enhancement 
factor at 1020°K of 5.5± 1.5, which may be compared directly with the factor 8 obtained on dividing the measured <SUP>12</SUP>
susceptibility at 1020°K by an estimate of the integral of  
<I>½g<SUP>2</SUP><FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT><SUB>B</SUB>N(E)[-df/dE]dE</I>
from the best available density-of-states curves.<SUP>13</SUP>
