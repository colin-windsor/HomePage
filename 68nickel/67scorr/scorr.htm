<P>   The spin correlations in a Heisenberg paramagnet have been calculated by solving numerically the motion of the spin vectors on a finite lattice of classical spins. A simple cubic array of a thousand spins was set up with some initial set of spin directions. The equation of motion of any individual spin <B>S<SUB>R</B></SUB> is determined by its commutator with the Hamiltonian. If we assume Heisenberg exchange interactions <I>2J</I><B> S<SUB>i</B></SUB>.<B>S<SUB>j</B></SUB>, between nearest-neighbour spins this may be evaluated to give</P>

</B></SUB><P>The spin changes <FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT><B>S<SUB>R</B></SUB> in a short finite time <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT>t</I> were evaluated for every spin in the lattice at successive times updating all the spin directions at the end of each time interval. Periodic boundary conditions were used so that all spins in the lattice were equivalent. At infinite temperatures any random set of spin directions sufficed as a possible initial spin configuration. At finite temperatures, not considered here, a configuration must be found where the initial energies of the spins satisfy a Boltzmann distribution (Harris 1964). If the time increment <FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT>t is small compared with the natural unit of time <I>h/2JS</I><B>/</B>2<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT>, the motion of the whole spin system is determined as a function of time. It is then straightforward to evaluate the correlations &lt;<B>S<SUB>0</B></SUB>(0).<B>S<SUB>R</B></SUB>(t)&gt; between an initial spin direction and that of a neighbouring spin distant <B><I>R</B></I> observed at a later time <I>t</I>. In this classical approximation the expectation value could be interpreted as a simple average taken over all equivalent neighbours in the finite lattice and possibly also over different initial spin configurations.

z<SUB>R</SUB> depending on the multiplicity Z<SUB>R</SUB> of each type of neighbour, but are substantially independent of the size of the lattice, the initial spin configuration and the finite size of the time increment used in calculating the motion. Conservation of total spin requires that the sum of the correlations over all neighbours should be constant independent of time (de Gennes 1958). The curve labeled 24 in figure 1 shows this sum for the correlations recorded in the computation. Its deviation from unity represents the contribution of correlations from more distant neighbours. These become rapidly more difficult to compute as their magnitude approaches the statistical error. For sufficiently remote neighbours the classical theory of diffusion through a uniform medium should apply. In fact, the correlations calculated using this theory (de Gennes 1958) are in only qualitative agreement with the computed curves. The correlations are observed to be even functions of time. It follows that the correlations in a ferromagnet and in an antiferromagnet are identical in this infinite temperature limit.</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P> Figure 1. Spin correlations between various neighbours in a simple cubic paramagnet with nearest-neighbour Heisenberg exchange interactions. The correlations are multiplied by the multiplicity of each type of neighbour. The lattice contained 1000 spins and the results were averaged over 10 different initial configurations. The time increment used in calculating the motion was 0.01 units. The data required over two hours computing time on an IBM 7030.</P></DIR>

A check on accuracy is provided by the fact that its area and root-mean-square energy width come within 2% of the exact values calculated using de Gennes' theory of the moments. of the computed curve differs from the Gaussian proposed by de Gennes in being appreciably more peaked at small energies, a region where the moment calculations are not sensitive.
