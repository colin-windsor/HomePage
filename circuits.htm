<H1>Fuses: the electric circuits</H1><P><HR></P>
<P>
All the electric circuit fuses are to the left of the front door.
There are 11 circuits, each with their own fuse and switch. Numbered left to right they are:

<P>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Lights: Kitchen and bed 1
<P>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Stair lights: Bed 1 lights and plugs: kitchen plugs N wall:attic
<P>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
<P>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bed 2&3 Plugs
<P>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Kitchen lights
<P>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Kitchen plugs: E wall
<P>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Kitchen boiler plug
<P>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Kitchen oven
<P>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Lounge S wall
<P>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bed2&3 lights
<P>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Lounge: Lights and outside light

<P> The fuses are cylindrical and of two sizes. There are spares on the main switch casing.

<P> Circuits 4 to 11 are embedded in conduits and fairly modern. Circuits 1 and 2 are a
of uncertain age. Circuit 2 includes the old lamps on the first set of stairs, and 
includes an old plug at the top of the stairs. It also supplies all electricity to 
bedroom 1, including the light, the old electric plugs on either side of the bed,
and the plug on the N wall, also feeding the kitchen N wall.
<p>Circuit 2 also feeds the attic. The plugs were originaly on a ring circuit, but one side is is now disconnected. The lights areon a separately fused circuit.
