<p>The old  fountain/washplace/paddling pool gives us cool 
running water all the year round. The house is just behind 
the car </i>

<P>In May last year we bought the little house below near 
Goring’s twin town of Belleme, two hours drive South of 
Caen in Normandy. It has 3 bedrooms and lovely views 
from the garden. Belleme forest is on our doorstep 
with gorgeous walks and cycle rides. The house is at 
St Martin de Vieux Belleme, whose church altar is shown 
overleaf.
