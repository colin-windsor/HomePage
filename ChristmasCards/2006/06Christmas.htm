<P>In February 2006 Colin finally finished his digital organ. 
<BR>It was made to the Electronic Organ Builders Society design 
of Colin Pykett. It sounds great. 
By folding down the music stand, it becomes a computer and personal video recorder— a multimedia miracle!

<P>Colin’s physics is going just fine. In March he gave a talk at Boston.
