<P>For Rogation time Mo organized a concert with much music 
including our Streatley Church and Two-a-Part choirs

<P>Colin’s 70th was celebrated very happily by family and friends 
at Lizzy and James’ house. 
Much gorgeous food was consumed! Mo made a bicycle-like cake.

<P>116 New Road is getting greener! 
<BR>In the summer Colin did a DIY 
installation of the Navitron solar water heating system.

It works really well on sunny days even in November

<P>A new water butt feeds rain water to  our bathroom toilet. 
James’ old garage door frame was used to elevate it so 
there are no pumps. Two float valves allow either mains or 
rain water to be used.

<P>These new LED star-lights take only three watts and delight 
us with their starry glow in our hall
