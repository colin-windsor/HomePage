<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P><I>In June Mo retired from being organist 
of Streatley Church. 
<BR>They gave her a great send off. 
<BR>We made this oak cross from the old Binns organ. </I>

<P>In March we both exhibited mine detection at the Big Bang Science 
exhibition in London then went to Marrakech for Colin to present 
the work at a mine conference which Mo also attended. 
Afterwards we had a week at Essauria by the sea.

<P>In April Andy and Justin had a  big “O” birthday party here. 
Thanks to James for the sign!

<P>In August we sang at Hereford and St David’s Cathedrals. 
We enjoyed delightful camping on the cliffs at St David’s.

<P>This year Colin gave up half his allotment as there is now a 
waiting list for plots! We grew leeks, spinach, broccoli, 
sprouts, rhubarb, raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrents, 
gooseberries, pears, carrots, courges, artichokes, 
beans, sweet corn, tomatoes and yes parsley and shapely radishes!

<P>In September we had a few delightfully warm days at Torquay in a nice hotel with lots of dancing. 

<P><IMG SRC="Fig7.jpg">
<P>Our friend Jesse offered us some old wooden organ pipes from her loft. 
They sounded so good that Colin determined to make a single rank pipe organ. 
Mo wanted to be able to do hand pumping! By September it was all working! 
We love it!

<P>It is good to report that the wood-burning stove gave us warm happy evenings and saved much gas last winter. This November Colin built a needed wood store. 


<P>Wishing you all the best for a
<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><P><I>Happy Christmas</I></FONT></B>             
<P>and a joyful New Year in 2013
