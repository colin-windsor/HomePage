<DIR></I><B>Abstract</B>. Small-angle neutron scattering measurements on an Al-7.5 wt% Cr-1 wt% Fe
alloy, grown by vapour deposition, have revealed a sequence of changes in cluster shape 
during low-temperature precipitate growth. The interpretation arose from a Monte Carlo model 
which allowed the shape of particular clusters to be followed as a function of time and 
temperature, and compared with the corresponding scattering pattern. An evolution in 
cluster shape from predominantly linear, through planar, to roughly spherical was found, 
depending on the coordination number of cluster atoms stable at each temeprature.</B>.</DIR>

<P>Alloys grown by vacuum evaporation offer a unique opportunity to study the early stages 
of precipitation. Prepared at relatively low temperatures, they avoid the effects of 
quenching from an equilibrium high-temperature phase. They overcome the solubility 
restrictions imposed by the phase diagram, permitting high volume fractions of low-mobility 
solute atoms. For example the chromium concentration in quenched aluminium alloys is limited 
to less than 0.3 wt% (Rivlin and Raynor 1980), but this can be extended to 16 wt% by 
vacuum evaporation (Bickerdike <i>et al</I> 1965, 1986a, b). A more commercially useful alloy 
is Al-7 wt% Cr-1.2 wt% Fe, which has been prepared by co-deposition from an 
electron-beam-heated melt onto an aluminium substrate held at 260 C. The high volume 
fraction and low diffusion rates of chromium and iron in aluminium give an alloy which, 
after ageing, has the remarkable tensile strength of 800 MPa, good corrosion resistance, 
and a high degree of thermal stability (Bickerdike <i>et al</I> 1986c).


<P>Small-angle neutron scattering permits the size and shape of precipitate clusters to be 
followed during ageing (Kostorz 1979). Several recent experiments (Katano and lizumi 1984, 
Furusaka <i>et al</I> 1985) and Monte Carlo computations (Sur <i>et al</I> 1977, Binder 1977, 
Lebowitz <i>et al</I> 1983) have noted the scaling of the cluster structure factor, and the 
time evolution of cluster size, assuming the roughly spherical clusters predicted by the 
theory of Lifshitz and Slyozov (1985) (Marder 1985). Cluster shape can be revealed 
from the slope of the Porod plot of the logarithm of the macroscopic cross section 
d<FONT FACE="Symbol">S</FONT>/d<FONT FACE="Symbol">W;</FONT> as a function of the logarithm of the 
scattering vector <i>Q.</I> A slope of -1 at high <i>Q</I> values is characteristic of linear clusters, 
a slope of -2 of planar clusters and a slope of -4 of nearly spherical clusters 
(Kortorz 1979). This Letter reports scattering experiments showing a progression
in Porod plot slopes from -1.1 to -3.6 which is interpreted as an evolution in 
cluster shape during low-temperature segregation. Taken alone, this interpretation 
is not unique. Scattering data over a finite <i>Q</I> range can equally well be 
explained in terms of a size distribution of spherical clusters. Our interpretation 
is justified by examples of cluster growth from a Monte Carlo model whose Fourier 
transform gives a scattering pattern with Porod law slopes showing the same trend.

<P><P>Three time-dependent experiments were performed with the samples mounted in situ 
within a furnace held at 300, 350 and 400 C respectively. The small-angle neutron 
scattering instrument of the PLUTO reactor was operating at 6 A wavelength to give 
a useful <i>Q</I> range from 0.01 to 0.17 A<SUP>-1</SUP> (Page 1978). The sample thickness of 10 mm 
gave a transmission of 0.93 with negligible multiple scattering. Empty furnace 
and calibration runs, using a 1 mm thick light water sample, enabled the sample 
macroscopic cross section to be expressed in cm<SUP>-1</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> units. 
The furnace could be raised to temperature in less than 5 min. Runs were recorded 
at intervals of 10 to 120 min, according to the rate of change of the scattering, 
over periods of 24 h at each temperature. The points and error bars in figure 1 
show Porod plots of the data at selected times. The three sets of symbols 
correspond to the three temperatures, and it is seen that the later runs at 
lower temperatures superimpose well on early runs at higher temperatures. 
This correspondence defines a logarithmic shift in the time scale at each temperature. 
An Arrhenius plot of this shift against the inverse absolute temperature suggests 
a single activation energy of 1.9 +/- 0.1 eV. This effect has been seen before 
(Komura <i>et al</I> 1983). We use it to combine the cross sections measured at the 
three temperatures to give a segregation sequence whose effective time range 
at 350 C ageing temperature covers four decades from 0.5 minutes to 10 days.

<P>A key feature of figure 1 is the changing slope of the Porod plot. 
The points in figure 2 show this evaluated for each scattering distribution recorded, 
and plotted against the logarithm of the effective ageing time at 350 C. 
In each case the maximum slope is chosen. Near 2 h at 350 C the slope at low <i>Q</I> 
values stabilises near the value -2.5, but at the same time the Porod plot becomes 
curved and a steeper slope appears at high <i>Q.</I>

<P><P>This sequence of slopes can be reproduced by Monte Carlo computations on an 
idealised model of the real alloy. A binary alloy A<SUB>f</SUB>B<SUB>1-f</SUB> is assumed, with 
a concentration <I>f</I>=0.1 of A atoms distributed over a 16x16x16 simple cubic 
lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Nearest neighbour Ising interactions
<I>J</I> between A atoms only were assumed, 1/2<I>J</I> being the energy of a single A-A bond. 
The method of Metropolis <i>et al</I> (1953) was used to study the approach to equilibrium. 
The method follows previous calculations. However, its one parameter <I>kT/J</I>, where <I>kT</I> 
is the thermal energy, has been set to lower values than have been generally considered. 
Segregation into two phases first occurs at <I>kT/J</I>= 4.51. For values 
2 < <I>kT/J</I>< 4 conventional Ostwald ripening with roughly spherical 
clusters occurs, and will not be discussed here. The present computations 
were for <I>kT/J</I>=0.02, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1 and 2. 
Using assembler coding on the 68008 microprocessor of a Sinclair QL, a 
two-day 'run' completed around 2000 trial exchanges per site (<I>t<SUB>0</SUB></I>), 
sufficient for complete aggregation at the higher temperatures, to defines the time 
unit of the computation and may be related approximately to the diffusion constant of the 
A atoms in the alloy. The arrays were stored at a factor of two intervals 
from 1/8<SUP>th</SUP> to 2048 <I>t<SUB>0</SUB></I>, and indexed by labelling each A atom connected by 
nearest neighbour bonds to other A atoms as a distinct cluster (Sur <i>et al</I> 1977).

<P>The neutron scattering cross section can be calculated from the model through 
the pair correlation function <I>g(r, t)</I> as a function of neighbour distance <I>r</i> and

to the <I>k</I>th cluster, and zero otherwise, it is possible to define a cluster

and <I>z(r)</I> the multiplicity of the neighbours at distance <I>r</i>. 
The conventional total correlation function <I>g<SUB>t</SUB>(r, t)</I>is given by 
including all A sites as a single cluster. Figure 3 shows both evaluated 
as a function of <I>r</i>. The total function extrapolates at large <I>r</i> to the 
concentration <i>f</I>, while the cluster function approaches zero, together with 
its statistical error. The cluster scattering <I>S<SUB>c</SUB>(Q, t)</I> can then be evaluated 
from the Fourier transformation

<P>without the result being swamped by cumulative errors from the many small 
correlations at large <I>r</i>. In contrast the total scattering is evaluated (Binder 1977) 
by subtraction of the A atom mean density <I>n</i> to form the differences 
<I>(n<b>r</b><sub>i</sub> - n<SUB>bar</SUB>)</I>. These may decay at large <I>r</i>, but their statistical error remains, 
so that the high <i>Q</I> tail of the scattering, needed to define its exponent, 
is easily lost in noise. Interference correlations, given by the difference between 
the two functions, are lost, but then none were observed in the experiment.

<P>The maximum exponent in the computed cluster scattering is plotted as a function 
of time as the full curves in figure 2. The good fit with experimental ageing 
times at 350 C defines the computation step time as <I>t<SUB>0</SUB></I>=7 +/- 1 min, 
and the temperature scale as <I>kT</i>= 0.6J+/- 0.2J at 350 C. 
The broken and full curves in figure 1 show the computed scattering at 
<I>kT</i>=0.6<i>J</i> and 0.8<i>J</i> respectively. The overall <i>Q</I> and intensity scales were 
adjusted to fit experiment, but are constant over the figure. 
Generally the fit is good considering the serious shortcomings of the model: 
the Al-Cr-Fe alloy is face-centred, not simple cubic; the precipitate 
observed by x-ray and electron diffraction after ageing is not a chromium 
rich cluster, but a mixture of the fine precipitate seen by Bickerdike <i>et al</I> (1986a, b) 
and the monoclinic <i>Q</I> phase CrAl<SUB>7</SUB> observed by Cooper (1960).

three temperatures shown. The insets show the form of the same cluster at

<P><P>The changing morphology of the clusters during ageing was studied by 
identifying each cluster through its centre of gravity in the lattice, 
and tracing its growth, often from a chance fluctuation in the initial 
configuration, throughout the ageing sequence. By using the same pseudo-random 
starting configuration, the evolution of a particular cluster at different 
temperatures could be studied. Some example are shown in the inset in figure 4. 
Three regimes of temperature can be defined.

<P>(i) <I>kT << J</i>. At low temperatures the diffusing atoms aggregate into 
the string-like clusters aptly described as 'knots' by Merica (1932). 
At these temperatures an excitation breaking any bond is improbable, but 
atomic rearrangements leading to configurations of equal or lower energy remain possible. 
These allow the formation of links between the early clusters so forming the 
chains giving a -1 exponent.

<P>(ii) <I>kT < J</i>. At thermal energies appreciably less than that corresponding 
to an A-A bond, the single-bonded atoms at the ends of chains become strongly 
preferred sites for excitation. Condensation is most likely to occur onto at 
least double-bonded cluster sites. This process leads to plate-like structures 
which would give the -2 exponent seen in the early stages of aggregation in this 
and also in the experiment of Furusaka <i>et al</I> (1985).

<P>(iii) <I>kT <~ J</I>.  At intermediate thermal energies, double-bonded atoms on the corners of 
plates become the most likely sites for thermal excitation. These may diffuse away, but are 
most likely to find a site in the same cluster with at least triple-bonding. This is the 
coordination number of atoms at the corners of a cube and so is characteristic of 
three-dimensional structures giving the -4 exponent. The observation of the collapse 
of these diffuse clusters into a more spherical shape during ageing has been noted previously 
in both the experiment of Blaschko <i>et al</I> (1982) and in the simulations of Sur <i>et al</I>(1977).

<P>A quantitative description of these changes in shape is given by an asphericity factor

<P><DIR><I>A = <FONT SIZE=4>< </FONT> [4<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT>/3][5/3]<SUP>3/2</SUP>
[r<SUB>gk</SUB><SUP>3</SUP>/(a<SUB>0</SUB><SUP>3</SUP>N<SUB>k</SUB>)]<FONT SIZE=4> > </FONT></I></DIR> 

<P>depending on the radius of gyration <I>r<SUB>gk</SUB></I> of the <I>k</I>th cluster, and weighted according 
to cluster size <I>n<SUB>k</SUB></i>. This function approaches unity for a sphere. Figure 4 shows A 
evaluated for three temperatures as a function of time. At a low temperature, <I>kT</i>=Q.2J, A rises 
rapidly to form stable diffuse clusters. At an intermediate temperature, <I>kT</i>=O.SJ, A rises as 
before, but at a time depending on the temperature, the clusters compact themselves to 
form nearly spherical clusters. At a high temperature, <I>kT</i>= 2J, clusters must be compact 
to be stable, and A remains within a factor of two of unity.

<P>Thus our alloy corresponded to the intermediate temperature regime (<I>kT<~ J</i>), whose early 
stages were made accessible to experiment only by low-temperature vapour deposition. 
Our simple model both fits and explains the cluster evolution as measured by neutron 
scattering over four decades of time at an effective temperature.

<P>The experimental work was funded by the Ministry of Defence (UK). The calculations 
were undertaken as part of the underlying research programme of the 
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
