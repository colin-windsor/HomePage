<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>
In 1955 John Lawson, working at Harwell, defined a condition for
fusion power. His condition was the triple product of plasma density <I>n</I>,
temperature <I>T</I> and energy confinement time <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span><SUB>E</SUB></I>.
 Lawson determined that the condition <I>nT<span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span><SUB>E</SUB></I>
 >3.1021 keVsm<SUP>-3</SUP> must be met for fusion
reactions to be self-sustaining [1]. The task of fusion research since then
has been to approach his fusion condition, but the progress towards it
in the last two decades has been slow.
Spherical tokamaks could potentially offer a faster route to fusion
power through smaller, more compact machines.
The triple product can be written as <I>nT<span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span><SUB>E</SUB> 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>a b</span>B<SUB>T</SUB><SUP>2</SUP><span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span><SUB>E</SUB></I>, 
which shows that there are three crucial parameters. Having each term as large as
possible assists in achieving the Lawson condition. The parameter<I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span></I> is
the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic field pressure. It is an
important measure of the efficiency of a tokamak. <I>B<SUB>T</SUB></I> is the toroidal
magnetic field along the plasma path. The plasma energy confinement
time <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span><SUB>E</SUB></I> defines the time at which heat is lost from the plasma. It scales
with size - just as the rate of heat loss from a tea-cup is greater for
small cups than for large ones.
<P>These three factors lead to three options for taking fusion forward:
<BR>(i) Large size. This has been the option that the world has
chosen to take by concentrating on the ITER project. It has
a self-consistent design using the best low-temperature
superconducting magnets available around 2001 when the
design was finalised. But the ITER timescale has already taught
us that large size is no easy option.
<BR>(ii) High field. This option was promoted by Bruno Coppi. It
started with Alcator in 1969, included the FT-U at Frascati and
culminated in Alcator C-mod, which sadly closed in 2016. The
IGNITOR project, proposed in 1999, would produce a huge field
of ~13T for short pulses (as the cooled copper coils heat up),
but long enough for ignition to be achieved. The difficulty with
IGNITOR is to see how this concept could evolve into a long
pulse fusion power plant.
<BR>(iii) High beta. This option uses the spherical tokamak geometry to
raise the efficiency <span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span>, and so to obtain higher plasma pressure
for a given magnetic field. In 1998 the START spherical tokamak
team at Culham Laboratory in the UK achieved a breakthrough
by reaching <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span></I> values of order 40%, compared to the 6% or so
achieved in JET or the 4% or so expected in ITER.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><B>The high-beta, higher-field approach - spherical
tokamaks and high temperature superconductors</B></FONT>

<P>Spherical tokamaks have several advantages. Compared to
conventional, doughnut shaped devices, they are much more efficient
at confining the plasma, largely due to their compressed geometry. In
spherical tokamaks the plasma is concentrated close to the centre of
the torus where the magnetic field is highest, as shown in Figure 1.

Peng, showing how the field lines in a spherical tokamak
spend more time in the high field region close to the centre
rod. This improves the stability and performance of the
spherical tokamak.</B></FONT>

<P>Tokamaks have the remarkable ability to produce a self-driven plasma
current, known as the bootstrap current. In a spherical tokamak the
bootstrap current makes a larger contribution to the total current,
reducing the need for expensive external current drive systems.

<P>With these advantages, and following the impressive efficiencies
of <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span>=</I> 40% achieved on START, 
several groups around the world
considered the economics of a spherical tokamak power plant. The
problem of spherical tokamaks is that they imply a slender central core,
with minimal space for shielding. A copper centrepost using steady-state water
cooling is feasible and can be replaced when neutron damaged. 
However all studies came to a similar conclusion:
that the heat dissipated in the copper limited the toroidal field to
around 2T, necessitating large plasma size for fusion gain. Using
low temperature superconductors was not an option, as the large
neutron shield to prevent neutron bombardment from heating the
superconductor beyond the necessary <4.2K operating temperature
would again lead to a huge device.

<P>For short pulse research devices ohmic heating in a copper core is
manageable by cooling the copper to liquid nitrogen temperatures, and
allowing the core to heat up during the pulse. This is the option being
explored in the ST40 tokamak currently being assembled at Tokamak
Energy which was described in a previous Nuclear Future article [2].
The discovery of high temperature superconductor (HTS) materials by
Bednorz and Muller in 1986 offered new possibilities.
The change in operating temperature from 4.2 to 20 or 30K implied
a factor of 5 or more reduction in cryogenic power and quite changed
the viability of the plant. A fusion pilot plant could be built with a
neutron shield thin enough to allow a relatively small device and thick
enough to allow the HTS centre rod to be cooled by a cryoplant of
acceptable size.

<P>Tokamak Solutions was set up in 2009 specifically to explore the possibilities 
of spherical tokamaks using HTS magnets for neutron
production. In 2014 the company became Tokamak Energy - to explore
the prospects for fusion power with the same technology.
How small could a fusion power plant be?
The conventional view supporting large tokamaks is well described
by Hartmut Zohm in his 2010 paper "<I>On the minimum size of DEMO"</I>:
the proposed demonstration fusion reactor [3]. As shown in blue
in Figure 2, equation 1 of his paper says that when the normalised
plasma pressure <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span><SUB>N</SUB></I>,
the toroidal field <I>B<SUB>T</SUB></I>, the safety factor <I>q<SUB>95</SUB></I> and the
aspect ratio <I>A</I> are all kept constant, the fusion power increases as the
3rd power of the major radius. The case for large machines appeared
strong.

<P>Alan Costley, Figure 3, has had a successful career in fusion spanning
over 40 years. After working on JET at Culham, Costley worked for 16
years within the ITER project in San Diego, Naka and Cadarache. When
he retired from his last post as head of Diagnostics Division at ITER in
2013, he joined Tokamak Energy in a consultancy role.

<P>Costley began his work on the size of tokamaks because he wanted
to check for himself whether the HTS spherical tokamak scenario
was likely to be a viable proposition. He set up his own system code,
combining together all the known equations and limits for tokamak
operation. After validation against other codes, he searched for viable
solutions with smaller size.



<P><IMG SRC="CGWFigure3.jpg" align=right><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=3><B>
Figure 3: Alan Costley</B></FONT>


<P>The crucial parameter for a fusion plant is the gain factor, <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I>, which
needs to be greater than one or energy breakeven, and large to make
a viable power plant. Costley's idea was to make fusion gain <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I> a
constant input parameter to the calculations, so that the conditions
leading to high fusion gain in a compact device could be more easily
identified.

<P>At the same time, he introduced checks to ensure that the wellknown
limits to plasma stability were satisfied. Tokamaks are subject to
operational limits, which mean that they will not work if an important
variable exceeds a particular value.
Take the density limit, for example. Generally, increasing plasma
density improves performance - until we reach a point where the
plasma suddenly collapses and confinement is lost. So Costley set the
actual plasma density divided by the Greenwald limit <I>f<SUB>GW</SUB></I> to be at most
0.8, and set the normalised plasma pressure 
<I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span><SUB>N</SUB></I>  divided by the Troyon
beta limit <I>f<SUB>beta</SUB></I> to be at most 0.9. Since high density and high plasma
pressure are both desirable for high fusion gain, the best plasma
conditions would be those that would approach these limits.

<P>A further condition Costley imposed was to do with the crucial
parameter of energy confinement time <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span><SUB>E</SUB></I>. The "<I>H</I> factor" is the ratio
of energy confinement time to its value predicted from scaling laws.
Costley set it to be at an optimal defined value consistent with recent
results from leading experiments.

<P>What he discovered using this code surprised even him.
The red dashed line in Figure 2 shows the nearly constant fusion
power with plasma radius given by Costley's Tokamak Energy system
code with the aforementioned assumptions and fusion conditions
similar to a nominal ITER configuration. Under these conditions, the
performance of the tokamak does not change with size. This was an
unexpected result because traditional thinking was that as devices get
larger their performance improves. As Costley and his colleagues have
shown, this lack of improvement with size is due to the interaction of
the positive size scaling in the confinement time with the negative size
scaling in the operational limits, especially the density limit.

<P>There was another unexpected and important finding from this
work. Since it is not possible to determine the confinement time from
first principles, scaling laws are developed based on large quantities of
tokamak experimental data.
In the early 2000s, it was thought that the confinement time scaled
inversely with the plasma beta. However, dedicated experiments
on several individual tokamaks showed that the scaling is almost
independent of beta, and alternative beta independent scalings were
developed. Costley and his colleagues examined the impact of these
scalings and found that the power needed to achieve a significant
fusion gain was a factor of two to four lower than previously thought
necessary.

<P>Combined with the result of the independence of the performance
with size, this opens up the possibility of relatively small tokamaks
operating at relatively low power but still achieving high fusion gain.
This work was published in the Costley, Hugill, Buxton 2015 paper
[4] with the important conclusion that, under his specified conditions,
the fusion gain <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I> depends on fusion power <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I> and on the <I>H</I> factor,
but only weakly on size <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>.
The paper caused a stir in the fusion community and has remained
the most downloaded paper in nuclear fusion since its publication.
Interest expanded with a second paper from Costley [5] in 2016
detailing the argument in the more familiar terms of the Lawson triple
product. This paper soon reached number two in the nuclear fusion
download lists.

<P>There is no criticism of the ITER design in Costley's results. ITER was
designed using the available scaling laws and technology, especially the
low temperature superconductors, around 2000. The superconductors
required shielding of order 1m thick, and inevitably implied a large
device. Spherical tokamaks were in their infancy at the time of the
ITER design, as were HTS magnets. Costley's results imply that the
performance of ITER will be better than originally expected because the
device can operate at high fusion power.

<P>A critical comment on this work was submitted by Biel <I> et al</I> [6]. Its
argument centred on the differing parameters that were held constant
in each scan: <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span><SUB>N</SUB></I>,<I>B<SUB>T</SUB></I> , <I>H</I> factor 
and <I>q<SUB>95</SUB></I> in the Zohm scan; and the
fusion gain <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I>, density and beta limit fractions in the Costley scan. A
reply was also published [7].

<P>Figure 4 shows other variables that help to understand why the two
scans have such dramatic differences.
For example, in the Costley scan the toroidal field <I>B<SUB>T</SUB></I> increases to
keep the beta limit constant as the plasma radius decreases. The red
cross pointed at by the arrow shows the toroidal field of the IGNITOR
proposal mentioned earlier. Biel <I> et al</I> argued that the higher toroidal
fields had long been known to lead to smaller fusion devices and this
is certainly one factor contributing to higher fusion gain. But it is only
part of the story - the impact of the beta-independent scaling is also
important as Costley and colleagues have shown.

<P>Biel <I> et al</I> [6] also argued that engineering constraints would limit any
reduction in size. The wall loading <I>P<SUB>wall</SUB></I> is the power deposited on each
square metre of the plasma wall. Decreasing the plasma radius eases
the wall loading in the Zohm scan, as <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I> falls very rapidly as shown in
Figure 2, but causes an appreciable increase in the Costley scan. Such
considerations severely limit how much the plasma radius could be
decreased. The DEMO wall load of 2.3 MWm<SUP>-2</SUP> would be reached at a
plasma radius just under 2.5 m within the Costley scan.


<P><IMG SRC="CGWFigure4.jpg" align=right><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=3><B>
Figure 4. Plots of the toroidal field, density limit fraction and
wall loading, as they change (or remain constant) during the
Zohm scan (full symbols and continuous lines) and Costley
scan (open symbols and dashed lines). 
These plots are for the same large aspect ratio as in Figure 2. </FONT></B>


<P>The density limit fraction is maintained in the Costley scan while it
decreases significantly in the Zohm scan as seen by <I>f<SUB>GW</SUB></I> in Figure 4. At
a radius of 2 m in the Zohm scan, the Greenwald density limit fraction
is only around 0.5 compared with the 0.8 of the Costley scan. The
density is a critical factor in the Lawson criterion.

<P>We conclude that, for conventional aspect ratio, smaller size fusion
devices of <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I> around 5 are inevitably of the high field IGNITOR
type and have high wall loadings. However we will show that when
applying the Costley scaling at the low aspect ratio of the Spherical
tokamak much more promising solutions can be found.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><B>What shape should a fusion power plant be?</B></FONT>



<P>The advantages of fusion power plants based on spherical tokamaks
are demonstrated in Figure 5, which differs from figure 4 in being for a
spherical tokamak with aspect ratio 1.8 and a correspondingly higher
<I>H</I> factor of 1.9.

<P>Results are calculated using the Tokamak Energy system code for
a constant fusion gain of 5. In this study the fusion power <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I> is
deliberately reduced to 200MW, to enable a smaller module which has
high energy gain but at acceptable wall loading. Compared with Figure
3 the plasma radius scale is reduced by a factor 4 yet the toroidal
magnetic field is actually less. The wall load power is generally larger
and again increases with decreasing radius, but stays below the 2.3
MWm<SUP>-2</SUP> limit for <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> > 1.3 m.

<P>Several engineering parameters are shown in Figure 5. The stresses
caused by the current down the centre rod interacting with the toroidal
field are compressive and roughly constant with radius, with values
which are high but manageable. Another important parameter is the
magnetic field at the outer edge of the superconducting conductor
denoted by <I>B<SUB>cond</SUB></I>. If this field becomes higher than a limiting value, say
25T for HTS tapes held at 30K, then a quench may occur. The values of
around 20 T of this field across the figure are large but acceptable.

<P>For long-pulse operation, using HTS is the only option for a steadystate
Spherical Tokamak. Then a key engineering parameter is the
heat deposition into the central superconducting core <I>P<SUB>heat</SUB></I>. This is seen
from Figure 5 to reduce exponentially with radius over a wide range.
The 100 kW heating at radius 1.35 m is manageable. as the cryogenic
power <I>P<SUB>cry</SUB></I>, is then some 5 MW, a small fraction of the 200 MW fusion
power.

<P>Another concern is the degradation of the HTS tape performance
that may occur during irradiation from the neutron and gamma flux
entering the central core after passing through the neutron shield. The
full triangles in Figure 5 show the neutron flux above 0.1 MeV for the
outer surface of the superconducting core as measured in the central
mid-plane region where the flux is highest.

<P>It remains an unanswered question how HTS tapes, held at 20 to
30K temperatures, will respond to the particular neutron flux energy
distribution behind a neutron shield.
Experimental studies have been performed by Eisterer and
colleagues [9], to test the performance of irradiated HTS tapes in the
Vienna TRIGA Mark II fission reactor. The neutron dose was estimated
by placing a nickel foil adjacent to the specimens, and calculating the
fast neutron fluence (E>0.1 MeV). Experiments were performed up to
a neutron fluence of 3.9x10<SUP>22</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP>.

<P>Their results showed that the critical current, when superconductivity
was lost, actually increased for low fluences of order 10<SUP>22</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP>, but that
at larger doses the critical current and critical temperature decreased.
These results must be treated with caution as they were made at
ambient temperatures rather than the 30K or so expected during
operation. Superconductivity tests were done over temperature ranges
from around 30K to 80K, and showed that below 60K, radiation
improved conductivity. Above 60K, it reduced it. Clearly work is
needed with irradiation fluxes closer to that expected behind the
neutron shield of a fusion plant.

Figure 5. The radial dependence of plasma parameters for a spherical
tokamak fusion module of aspect ratio A=1.8 and constant <I>H<SUB>IPB98y2</SUB></I>= 1.9.
The central temperature adjusted to give 0.8 of the Greenwald density
limit, and the toroidal field adjusted to give 0.9 of the
beta limit. The extra space made available by increasing
the major radius has been divided in the ratio 92% to
the shield thickness <I>T<SUB>shield</SUB></I> and 8% to the HTS core
radius across the plot. The crosses represent MCNP
computations of <I>P<SUB>heat</SUB></I>. Further details of this scan
are given in [8]  </FONT></B>

<P>Accordingly, the black lines in Figure 6 showing the full power
running time (in seconds) before the fluence reaches a value of 10<SUP>23</SUP>
m<SUP>-2</SUP> must be treated with caution. However it suggests that a month
continuous running of this 200MW module would be possible at 1.7 m
radius and 10 years of running at 2.4 m.

<P><IMG SRC="CGWFigure6.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=3><B>

of the mid-plane region of the superconducting core for
neutron energies above 0.1 MeV is shown by the full blue
triangles (right-hand scale). The number of seconds of
continuous full power running which correspond to a total
neutron fluence of 10<SUP>23</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP> are shown by the open diamonds
(left hand scale).
</FONT></B>



<P>From these studies, it appears that a ST fusion module of around
100-200 MW fusion power and with useful fusion gain should be
viable; the main uncertainty being the lifetime of the HTS tape under
neutron irradiation. A short lifetime would require use of a thicker
shield, leading to a larger and less economic module; however it
is quite possible that more resilient HTS tapes could be developed
especially for fusion applications.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><B>Economics of compact, modular fusion</B></FONT>


<P>Most are familiar with economies of scale. For energy projects this
principle leads to the assumption that the cost per MWh of electricity
can be reduced by increasing the plant size. Certain costs, such as site
acquisition, construction and operation, increase only modestly with
size and are outweighed by the increased power output.

<P>However, as the size of the project grows, so too does the
complexity, not just of engineering, but of management, funding
and political influence. Energy sector studies into large, so called
megaprojects, such as hydroelectric dams and nuclear reactors, have
shown that they have the "greatest amount and frequency of cost
overruns, even when normalised to overrun per installed MW" [10,
11].

<P>Pursuing a modular approach keeps fusion power plants from
becoming megaprojects. The benefits of economies of scale are still
seen in the manufacturing processes, for example, by achieving cost
reductions in the production of HTS tape as more is produced, or by
designing tokamaks with components suitable for factory production.

<P>Modular reactors also benefit from economies of multiples, where
cost savings are introduced when the same identical plant (e.g. a
fusion plant) is delivered several times. This is rooted in the idea of
mass production, a concept born in the automotive industry and
aerospace. Repetition leads to industrial learning, which ultimately
results in cost reductions. This is not only true of manufacturing but
also of construction and plant operation.

<P>Deploying numerous lower power units, 100-200MW, on a single
site also offers greater flexibility to modify the power output by adding
or removing reactor modules.
Making incremental capacity additions leads to savings, as the
upfront siting costs have already be carried out. The more power
plant units per site, the lower the investment cost per unit. The
benefits of economies of scale are realised without the inherent risk
of megaprojects, and with the added benefits of mass production and
learning economies.

<P>There are further operational advantages of the modular approach.
A fusion reactor will require a dedicated maintenance area, known as
a hot cell, where it may be serviced safely. Multiple smaller reactors
operating on a single site could share such resources, greatly reducing
their size and cost. Reactor modules could also be serviced in turn
allowing continuity of electricity supply and reducing the impact of
faults.

<P>Small, modular fusion plants, such as those proposed by Tokamak
Energy, will be able to benefit from these various factors.

<P>Reducing the size of the final reactor also means prototypes can be
developed quickly and at greatly reduced cost. Scientists can rapidly
test and advance their hypothesises, while engineers can complete the
design-procure-manufacture cycle on much shorter time scales, taking
advantage of the latest techniques and materials. Smaller machines
also offer access to a wider range of suppliers and the chance to
develop supply chain relationships and drive improvements in supplier
capabilities.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><B>Taking advantage of experience in the nuclear
industry</B></FONT>


<P>Tokamak Energy plans to accelerate the deployment of fusion power
by combining the high efficiency and improved stability of the spherical
tokamak with the strong magnetic fields and lower cryogenic power
requirements (compared to low temperature superconductors) of HTS
magnets.
In combination, these complimentary technologies could allow for
efficient energy production in a compact device of modest power
output, a concept otherwise unachievable.

<P>Reducing the size of the final reactor means prototypes can be
developed quickly and at greatly reduced cost. Working close to the
mainstream, but able to tolerate greater risks, a feature inherent to
the compact approach, creates an attractive proposition for private
investment.

<P>The task of delivering fusion power is no longer only the
responsibility of national laboratories and global megaprojects.
Privately funded ventures working in conjunction with established
industrial partners and universities could make significant progress.

<P>Fusion must take advantage of the experience and capabilities of
the existing nuclear industry, such as small modular fission reactors and
decentralised power distribution.
