<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=6>Summary</FONT>

<P>This introduction reviews the unique opportunity of fusion power to deliver safe, carbon-free, abundant, base 
load power. The differences with fission power are considered: especially why a Chernobyl, Three Mile Island 
or Fukishima accident could not happen with a fusion reactor. The Lawson triple product is introduced, along 
with tokamaks, or magnetic bottles, whose ability to approach close to the fusion burn conditions has so far 
put them above their competitors. Our last fusion power Discussion Meeting was organised by Derek 
Robinson FRS in 1998, and the progress since then is reviewed.  Tokamaks are introduced, and the advantages 
of spherical tokamaks are listed along with the special engineering challenges that they introduce. Their key 
advantage is high plasma pressure, and the important beta parameter indicating the efficiency of the magnetic 
field use is introduced.  High temperature superconductors are described along with the opportunities they 
allow for higher magnetic fields at higher current densities and more modest cryogenic temperatures. The 
question posed is whether the two developments of spherical tokamaks and high temperature 
superconductors could lead to more economical fusion power plants and faster development than the current 
route through ITER and DEMO.  

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=6>Why we need fusion energy?</FONT>
<P>Fusion energy already dominates our energy use, for the sun (figure 1) is our solar system&apos;s fusion power 
plant, providing us now with the energy to power our solar voltaic cells and to make the wind blow, and in 
the past through photo-synthesis to capture carbon dioxide and create our heritage of fossil fuels, coal, oil and 
gas.  It is now nearly 100 years ago, in 1920, that astro-physicist Eddington in his address to the British 
Association entitled “The Internal Constitution of the Stars” described the mechanism that the sun uses to 
sustain its energy production. His address is still with us on the web [1]. It included the prophetic statement: 
“This reservoir can scarcely be other than the sub-atomic energy which, it is known, exists abundantly in all 
matter; we sometimes dream that man will one day learn how to release it and use it for his service. The store 
is well nigh inexhaustible, if only it could be tapped. There is sufficient energy in the sun to maintain its 
output of heat for 15 billion years. “

<P>It was an idea whose time had come. In 1905 Einstein had shown that through relativity, energy and mass 
were interchangeable through the famous <I>E=mc<SUP>2</SUP></I> equation [2]. In that same year of 1920, Aston had carefully 
measured the masses of many of the elements and noted that they did not simply scale with the number of 
nuclides in the atom [3].  Figure 2 shows this excess energy for each nuclide plotted against the atomic 
number. It is seen that there is a broad minimum at around iron with atomic number 26. This is the reason 
why 90% of the earth&apos;s inner core is made from iron! There is relative instability at much higher or much 
lower atomic numbers than can release this energy. Fusion is the process by which light nuclei such as 
deuterium <SUP>2</SUP>H and tritium <SUP>3</SUP>H come together to make helium <SUP>4</SUP>He and a neutron in the reaction:
<P><SUP>2</SUP>D + <SUP>3</SUP>T = <SUP>4</SUP>He + n +17.6 MeV		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;			(1)

<P>This nuclear reaction requires the deuterium and tritium ions to have enough energy, or temperature, to 
overcome the familiar Coulomb repulsion of their positive charges. As the separation approaches nuclear 
diameters, quantum interactions take over, but the energies required for D-T fusion are still of order 10 keV, or 
more than 100 million degrees K. This presents a real challenge for the realisation of fusion power. 

<P><IMG SRC="PTCGWFigure1.jpg"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" Size=2><P>
Figure 1.  The sun (left) is our own solar system&apos;s fusion power plant, but with the plasma confined by gravity. The objective is to make 
our own fusion power plant on earth using tokamaks with confinement by magnetic fields as in the START tokamak (right) </FONT> 

<P>The 17.6 MeV of fusion energy from each reaction comes directly from the difference in mass between the 
deuteron + triton and the helium + neutron masses. From conservation of momentum the energy is split 
roughly 4:1 between the lighter neutron and the 4-times heavier helium, so that the neutron energy is the 
famous 14.1 MeV and the alpha particle carries the remaining 3.5 MeV.   There are two reaction products. The 
neutron (n) has the most energy, which may be used to heat up a water jacket to make electricity and can also 
be used to produce more tritium from the breeding reaction. The stable helium nucleus or alpha particle 
carries the remaining 3.5 MeV of energy, but its charge means that it interacts with the electrons in the plasma 
and gives up its energy rapidly so helping to sustain the ion temperature and the fusion reaction. 

<P>Our world is running out of options for generating sustainable, safe, CO<SUB>2</SUB>-free, base-load electricity. Base-load 
can be defined as capacity available for most of most days. Some of these options are listed in table 1. None of 
us quite expected the very rapid decrease in solar panel costs that has taken place over the last decade. There 
is now &quot;Swanson's law&quot; [4]: the observation that over two decades, the price of solar photovoltaic modules 
dropped 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume. It demonstrates well the utility of 
multiple-of-a-kind manufacture. Wind power has followed a similar if less dramatic path. But the intermittent 
nature of both sources makes them unable to contribute to the base-load on cloudy wind-less days. Such days 
can persist for months. 

<P>Perhaps one day, battery power will solve this problem but not yet.  The biggest batteries so far have been of 
order 32 MWh and the UK daily electricity use is around 1TWh so there remains a big gap to be filled on 
cloudy, wind-less winter months. Coal, oil and gas will always remain as precious as raw resources, of finite 
magnitude, useful in many ways. But burning them for heat seems not part of a sustainable planet. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
they produce can in principle be captured by the technique of carbon sequestration, where the CO<SUB>2</SUB> is frozen 
out from the power station exhaust gases and pumped to some old gas field for storage. In practice this 
technique has not yet proved commercially viable, and no such plant exists at present.  Burning coal, with its 
associated sulphur dioxide emissions, is also a serious health hazard by any standards. 
 
<P><IMG SRC="PTCGWFigure2.jpg">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" Size=2><P>Figure 2. 
The graph shows the excess energy of different nuclei plotted against atomic mass. The very light atoms have a high excess energy and can 
become more stable by fusing together to produce larger nuclei. Heavy nuclei can become more stable by splitting up to produce fission products of 
intermediate mass.</FONT>  
   	
<P>Geothermal and hydro share with coal, oil and gas the fact that they are not uniformly available over our earth 
in the quantities needed to provide base-load power. Gas pipelines can partially overcome this but carry the 
risk that supplies can be cut for political reasons.  Electricity interconnectors carry a similar risk, and until we 
have an interconnector circling the globe, there is the problem that cloudy, wind-less weather can persist over 
whole continents!

<P>Fission power ticks many of the boxes, although fast reactors, which breed their own fissile material, are 
necessary for truly sustainable energy. Fission energy, which the UK pioneered, has served us well, but it is 
not without risk and its public acceptance is fragile. There are three serious risks, as illustrated in figure 3:
<P>i)	A fission reactor carries within its core a great deal of fuel, which in the wrong circumstances can 
lead to a catastrophic criticality as at Chernobyl. 
<P>ii)	After a fission reactor has been running for some time it contains appreciable quantities of highly 
radioactive fission products. If their containment is breached, as at Three Mile Island, serious 
contamination can result.
<P>iii)	After a fission reactor is shut down for any reason, there is a good deal of &quot;delayed heating&quot; as its 
fuel continues to produce enough heat to melt the core, as at Fukishima. 
   
<P><IMG SRC="PTCGWFigure3.jpg">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" Size=2><P>
Figure 3.  The three accidents that changed the public acceptance of fission power, and why they are not an issue in fusion reactors. (a) In a fusion 
reactor, fuel is continually injected so that there is no possibility of a &quot;criticality&quot; as at Chernobyl, (b) the fusion products of alpha particles and neutrons 
are benign compared with the release of highly active &quot;fission products&quot; as at Three Mile Island, (c) when a fusion reactor is shut down there is no 
&quot;delayed heat&quot; from fuel radioactive decay as at Fukishima. </FONT>

<P>Fusion power does not suffer from any of these three possibilities.  The tritium/deuterium fuel is 
continuously injected into the reactor, so there is only enough fuel to sustain the reaction at its current level. 
The fusion products are the relatively benign helium nuclei and neutrons. There is no possibility of delayed 
heating when a fusion reactor is stopped. The high energy neutrons cause damage to materials and activation, 
but these are not life-threatening issues.
       
We are left with fusion energy as the one option that ticks all the boxes!

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=6>What is a tokamak</FONT>

<P>In 1955 John Lawson at Harwell produced the classified report, now available to all [5], showing that the 
conditions for fusion could be written in the form: <I>nT<span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span><SUB>E</SUB></I> > 2.1021 m<SUP>-3</SUP> keV s, where <I>n</I> is the density, say ~4.10<SUP>20</SUP> 
m<SUP>-3</SUP>, <I>T</I> is the plasma temperature, say ~15 keV and <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span><SUB>E</SUB></I> is the energy confinement time say ~0.3 s. As John 
Lawson said at the time, &quot;even with the most optimistic assumptions, the conditions . . .  are very severe.&quot;  If the 
density and temperature conditions are expressed as a plasma pressure in atmospheres, it comes out as 
around 2000 atmospheres! How can this very high pressure be contained? Containment is easy on the sun, 
which has its own gravity. Here on earth, there are few options, but magnetic forces are one way appropriate 
for containing the high pressure, high-temperature plasma. Figure 4 shows the design sketched by George 
Thomson in a 1946 patent [6].

current is generated as the secondary winding of a transformer [6].</FONT>

<P>A circular torus contains the plasma, and a transformer is made with the torus as the secondary winding. A 
pulse of current down the primary circuit induces a toroidal current in the plasma, which heats up from ohmic 
resistance and is kept in the torus shape by the &quot;pinch&quot; effect of the magnetic field induced by the plasma 
current itself. The pinch effect dates from 1905 when Pollock and Barraclough [7] noticed that a tubular copper 
pipe in a lightening conductor collapsed onto itself as shown in figure 5.  Current on the edge of a current 
carrying wire feels the poloidal magnetic field from the wire, which creates an inwards force on the current 
carrying wire. The same force creates a powerful inward pressure on the current-carrying centre column of a 
spherical tokamak.

<P>The ZETA experiment at Harwell in 1957 was an example of a pinch effect torus. It showed much promise and 
produced copious neutrons, but these proved to be not the expected fusion neutrons but photo-neutrons from 
the high energy &quot;runaway&quot; electrons created by the high magnetic fields. The main reason for the failure to 
produce fusion neutrons was plasma instabilities, which have been the bugbear of fusion ever since. They 
reduced the energy confinement time to milliseconds, from the seconds expected from conventional particle 
Coulomb collisions. Anyone who has played with a plasma ball will have noted the plasma filaments are 
never still but continually suffer &quot;kink&quot; distortions. 

<P>Progress was made in Russia in the sixties where it was realised by Shafranov that the toroidal field BT along 
the path of the plasma torus was a key variable for improving stability and so plasma temperature. Stability 
was improved according to a safety factor <I>q=aB<SUB>T</SUB>/(R<SUB>0</SUB>B<SUB>P</SUB>)</I> where <I>a</I> is the plasma minor radius and <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> its major 
radius. This needed to be greater than about three for stability. As illustrated in figure 6, the period of the 
paths threading the torus governed by the toroidal field needs to be short compared with the period around 
the length of the torus governed by the poloidal field. If an aspect ratio <I>A</I> is defined as the ratio of the plasma 
major and minor axes <I>A=R<SUB>0</SUB>/a</I> it is seen that <I>q= B<SUB>T</SUB>/(AB<SUB>P</SUB>)</I> ~>3 and that stability is generally improved for low 
aspect ratios. It is this improved stability from the higher toroidal field, which defines a tokamak, and changed 
the direction of fusion research.

torus to the number around the torus. It should be higher than around three for stability.</FONT>

<P>With better stability there should be higher plasma temperatures. At the height of the cold war in 1969 Derek 
Robinson FRS was part of the team, the &quot;Culham five&quot;, that went to Moscow and first showed, using laser 
Thomson scattering, that temperatures in the T3 tokamak were indeed as favourable as had been claimed. 
Figure 7 shows him on the left with Volodya Sannikov, a co-author with him when the results were first 
presented in 1969.

<P>Derek Robinson sadly died at the height of his powers in 2002, and the fusion community owes him a great 
debt. He was the lead organiser 20 years ago in 1998 when the last Royal Society Discussion Meeting on fusion 
power &quot;The approach to an ignited plasma&quot; was held. 

<P>The proceedings of that meeting continue to be a good read [9].  The introductory talk by Roy Bickerton [10] 
was on the “History of the approach to ignition”. Figure 8 shows his 1998 predictions for the future with ITER 
operational in 2005, and DEMO in 2025!

<P>John Sheffield prophetically mentioned “global warning”, which was to change the public perception of the 
need for fusion power.  Martin Keilhacker presented results from the successful JET 1997 D-T campaign, 
which proved that serious fusion power of 16 MW could be generated on earth. This record power has never 
been exceeded. Derek Robinson presented the spherical tokamak START results with its record ?, the ratio of 
the plasma pressure to the pressure of the magnetic field required to contain the plasma. This important result 
was to open the field of spherical tokamaks, leading to the possibilities for smaller fusion power plants aired 
at this meeting. Farrokh Najmabadi talked of fusion power and the Aries project with its promise of GW 
electric power at 7.7 US cents per kWh, but the project was never funded. Joe Kilkenny talked of inertial 
fusion. The Livermore National Ignition Facility prediction was confidently expected to reach ignition by 
firing enough energy at a tiny “hohlraum” containing a frozen pellet with a few milligrams of the deuterium 
and tritium fuel. Calculations had suggested that success was near, but so far, the fusion power produced, has 
only been of order 1/3 of that needed for ignition. This is the reason that inertial fusion was not part of this 
meeting. Robert Aymar presented the ITER design and I remember the excitement we all felt that this project 
was leading to a burning plasma. His talk concentrated on convincing the meeting that the physics of the 
design was right.

power law, doubling around every two years [11]. From http://www.fusenet.eu/sites/default/files/moores_law.jpg </FONT>
  	
<P>The twenty years since then have been something of a setback. Figure 9 shows a figure from the European 
Fusion Educational Network [11]. The lower line in red squares shows Gordon Moore&apos;s law for transistors 
with a doubling of capacity every 2 years. The upper blue line with circles shows the triple product of plasma 
density, pressure and confinement time that John Lawson from Harwell derived in 1955 [3].  It increases 
slightly faster with a doubling time of 1.8 years.  A little research shows that Moore&apos;s law has continued 
certainly up to 2016, but not so for fusion. According to the plot, the triple product goal for ITER should have 
been achieved around 2008, but in 2018 the target for ITER tritium operations was 2035 [5]. It was the purpose 
of this Discussion Meeting to ask if development could be accelerated.

<P>In one sense we all know that one issue is the ITER project whose budget became a large fraction of the 
national fusion associations and their top priority. I can still remember the excitement that I felt in the late 
1980s when the ending of the cold war was sealed by the agreement between Gorbachov and Reagan to turn 
their swords into ploughshares by building ITER. We all accepted that this was the way forward: sharing our 
expertise so that the whole fusion world could join in making whatever was needed to approach an ignited 
plasma. In this Discussion Meeting no one said a word against ITER. The whole fusion community want to see 
it built. No photos of its construction were presented, so figure 10 is given as an example from 2018.

<P>What can we learn from ITER&apos;s 50-year long story illustrated in figure 11? Why was the timetable in 
Bickerton&apos;s figure not been achieved? The answer is clear in retrospect. ITER is an excellent example of a 
&quot;megaproject&quot;, technically a project whose cost is over $1B, (The ITER cost is above $20B). Studies of past 
megaprojects show that cost and time overruns are the norm rather than the exception, and that the cost 
overun tends to increase with the size of the project [12]. 

<P>One reason is that they tend to extend the boundaries of what has been done before and so encounter 
unpredicted problems leading to unexpected costs and delays. Another reason is that megaprojects often 
become too big for one company, one country, even one continent, and project management becomes difficult 
with long chains of responsibility. In ITER’s case, these problems were nicely documented in the report by 
Madia and Associates [13] who made many suggestions for improvements. Today these sound commonplace, 
even obvious:  like “Develop a realistic project schedule”.  Time will tell if a difference has been made.

<P>It was over thirty years ago in 1983 that Sykes, Turner and Patel [14] and later Peng [15] and Peng and 
Strickler [16] predicted the high plasma pressures <span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span> possible with low aspect ratio spherical tokamaks. <span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span><SUB>E</SUB> is the 
ratio of the plasma pressure <I>p<SUB>pla</SUB> = n.kT)</I> to the magnetic pressure 
<I>(p<SUB>mag</SUB> = B<SUP>2</SUP>/
2<span style='font-family:Symbol'>m</SPAN><SUB>0</SUB>)</i>. The theory showed that <span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span> 
could indeed be raised by a combination of low aspect ratio, and high elongation. Plasma pressure is a key 
variable as fusion power <I>P<SUB>F</SUB></I> can be written in terms of the toroidal field 
<I>B<SUB>T</SUB></I>, and plasma volume <i>V</i> as

<P><I>	P<SUB>F</SUB> = <span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span><SUP>2</SUP>B<SUB>T</SUB><SUP>4</SUP>V</I>                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                                                                                                                      (2)
<P>Peng and Strickler also noted the natural increase of plasma elongation 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>k</span> as the aspect ratio is reduced. Alan 
Costley has noticed that most tokamak designs tend to follow the relationship 
<I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>k</span> = 3.54A<SUP>1/2</SUP></I>                           (2). 
<P>Of course, 
elongation can also be increased by appropriate magnetic fields, but it will eventually become naturally 
unstable and require active feedback control. 

<P>A simple-minded explanation for these increases in efficiency is suggested by figure 12 which shows the 
toroidal magnetic field <I>B</I> in Tesla around a constant centre column carrying a current <I>I</I> as a function of radius 
<I>r</I>. The field is given by Ampere&apos;s Law 
<I>B=2<span style='font-family:Symbol'>m</SPAN><SUB>0</SUB>.I/4<span style='font-family:Symbol'>p</SPAN>r<SUP>2</SUP></I> or <I>B(T)=0.2.I(MA)/r(m)<SUP>2</SUP></I> so the smaller the radial distance the 
higher the field for a given centre rod current. For a current of 10 MA, the field is 2 Tesla at a radius of 1 m.  In 
the same way a plasma with higher elongation <span style='font-family:Symbol'>k</SPAN> and triangularity
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>e</SPAN> naturally squashes the plasma in towards 
the centre column, has a greater fraction of its volume at low radius, and so has a higher efficiency.

radius decreases according to Ampere's Law.  Higher shaping of the plasma (increased elongation and triangularity) increases the 
effective field for a given plasma radius. </FONT>
       
<P>The theory was put to the test with the small tight aspect ratio tokamak START which ran at Culham from 
1990 to 1998. It was a somewhat unofficial project steered by Programme Director Derek Robinson FRS, 
assembled from spare parts by Tom Todd, and run by theoretician turned experimentalist Alan Sykes and 
Mikhail Gryaznevich.

Martin Peng [16].  On the right. the plasma pressure as measured on the START spherical tokamak by Gryaznevich et al [17]. </FONT>

<P>.It soon had impressive beta values a factor three better than previous results as shown in figure 13 from the 
paper by Gryaznevich et al  [17].  It was helped by the ability of spherical tokamaks to give impressive 
photographs of the whole plasma, as was shown in figure 1.

<P>These results inspired a new generation of larger spherical tokamaks around the world. MAST at Culham and 
NSTX at Princeton showed that confinement times could be more favourable for spherical tokamaks. The 
experimental observation of the bootstrap current, driven by plasma pressure gradients, had been predicted 
theoretically by Bickerton, Connor and Taylor in 1971 [18] and observed experimentally on the Princeton 
tokamak TFTR by Zarnstorff et al, [19] in 1988 allowing the prospect of a power plant with reduced external 
current drive. 

<P>However, proposals for fusion power using a normal metal centre column had difficulties in that the power 
dissipation required large cooling plants and frequent replacement due to neutron damage. In 1998 in their 
paper “Spherical Tokamak route to Fusion Power” Stambaugh et al. [20] proposed a JET radius (R= 2.8 m) 
power plant with a cooled copper centre rod. It was soon followed by similar sized projects from Voss et al 
[21] at Culham and the US ARIES project by Najmabadi et al [22]. None of the projects were built. Much 
power was lost cooling the centre column, which needed to be replaced at intervals because of radiation 
damage. The conclusion was clear. Superconductors are necessary to allow the higher fields and lower energy 
dissipation from the centre column.

Ordinary low temperature superconductors date back to 1911 when Onnes demonstrated the complete 
disappearance of electrical conductivity in mercury at 4.2K.  Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical 
phenomena and it took until 1957 for Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer [23] to explain it satisfactorily. Electrons 
attract positive ions, which interact weakly with other positive ions through electron-phonon interactions to 
form an attractive bond, which overcomes the Ampere&quot;s law Coulomb barrier. A &quot;Cooper pair&quot; ground state 
of two electrons with zero net spin is created, which has an energy below the normal electron Fermi energy, 
which can be occupied at low enough temperatures. The electron-phonon energy is very weak, of order a 
milli-electron volt, and other non-superconducting states soon become occupied at modest temperatures 
above 4.2K and superconductivity is lost.

Figure 14. The perovskite structure the high temperature superconductor YBa<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>7-x</SUB>. The pure compound (x=0) is antiferromagnetic but 
at other levels electrons in the two-dimensional planes of copper and oxygen atoms form spin density waves and create Cooper pairs of 
spin zero which condense at low temperatures to form a superconducting Bose condensate.</FONT>

<P>High temperature superconductors (HTS) were discovered in 1986 by Bednorz and Müller [24].  The theory 
remains uncertain, but it seems likely that it is tied to the special case of the perovskite structure, and in the 
case of materials such as the perovskite YBCO, stoichiometry is a crucial factor. Its formula may be written 
YBa<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>7-x</SUB>, where x is the variable describing the non-stoichiometry. Superconductivity is found to exist 
only when x is less than 0.6. The superconducting temperature peaks at x=0.16. It is likely that Cooper pairs 
are again generated but this time through the magnetic interactions between the oxygen vacancies. The 
electron spin of 1/2 creates a spin density wave, which interacts with other electrons in a way analogous to 
the phonons of BCS superconductivity but with rather higher energies. The interacting electron spins once 
again create Cooper pairs of spin 0 or 1, which can condense into a superconducting Bose condensate. 
Interestingly the condensate is believed to lie along the copper-oxygen chains in the perovskite structure, 
introducing anisotropy with respect to the field direction into the superconductor performance. Electrostatic 
repulsion prevents the electron orbitals being on the same site: they are on the nearest-neighbour sites, with 
the unusual d-wave pairing wave function illustrated in figure 14.  A non-quantum water-bed analogy can 
again be made that the spin density wave interaction causes an energy depression in the surface. A second 
electron can form a similar depression, but coulomb repulsion prevents them alighting on the same atom so 
the depression takes up a nearest-neighbour position along the Cu-O-Cu chains.

~25T and at relatively low temperatures ~20K.  </FONT>

<P>Their importance is three-fold as illustrated in figure 15. Firstly, their superconducting temperatures can be 
much higher than for low temperature superconductors, say 92 K for YBCO, thus reducing cryogenic power 
needs. Secondly, superconductivity can exist at much higher magnetic fields, particularly if the temperature is 
reduced well below the transition temperature. This extends the plasma physics: a given fusion power can be 
achieved at lower volumes by a higher toroidal field. Thirdly, the current carrying capacity for a given area of 
conductor is increased allowing a given current to be carried in more slender cables as discussed in the next 
section.  Because of these properties, high temperature superconductors have the potential to be a game-
changer for magnetic confinement fusion research.

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=6>The opportunity presented by spherical tokamaks and high 
temperature superconductors</FONT>
<P>
The disadvantage of the spherical tokamak is clear. The need for a slender centre column imposes engineering 
and radial space constraints on any design. With low temperature superconductors the need for a neutron 
shield thicker than a metre makes a spherical tokamak unfeasible. However, the higher fields and operating 
temperature of high temperature superconductors opens a new opportunity.

Figure 16. The variation of tokamak major radius (lines) given by lower aspect ratio (X-axis) by and higher magnetic toroidal fields 
(Yaxis). The figure uses the equation shown from Costley&apos;s paper in this issue, using the relation Costley noted for the change in 
elongation (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>k</SPAN>) with aspect ratio. The data are scaled to the ITER operating point.  </FONT>

<P>Alan Costley&apos;s paper in this volume gives in his equation 2 the expression for the fusion triple product in 
terms of tokamak size <I>R=R<SUB>0</SUB><SUP>2</SUP></I>, toroidal field <I>B<SUB>T</SUB><SUP>3</SUP></I> and shape 
<I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>t</span><SUP>7/2</SUP>/A<SUP>3</SUP></I> for a tokamak plasma operating in steady-state

ratio.

<P><IMG SRC="PTCGWCostleyEquation.jpg">					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;							(3)
<P>As mentioned earlier, the elongation <span style='font-family:Symbol'>k</SPAN> increases naturally with decreasing aspect ratio <I>A</I>.  The empirical 
relationship has been evaluated by Costley as <span style='font-family:Symbol'>k</SPAN> = 3.54/A<SUP>1/2</SUP>. Incorporating this into the above equation gives

<P>In this equation the terms <I>H<SUP>2</SUP>/q<SUP>3</SUP></I>  can be thought of as constant values to be achieved. The equation applies 
generally, but scaling to ITER which has <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=6.2 m, <I>B<SUB>0</SUB></I>=5.3 T, and <I>A<SUB>0</SUB></I>=3.1, it becomes

<P>So that the plasma major radius for ITER fusion conditions scales inversely as the toroidal field to the power 
3/2, and rather strongly with aspect ratio to the power 19/8. Figure 16 illustrates this relationship when

The first paper is by Dan Clery whose brief was to tell us of the non-tokamak ways to fusion power, excluding 
the stellerator – a relative of the tokamak. It is a characteristic of new technologies that they involve risk. Some 
revisit abandoned schemes from the early days of fusion research. We have seen in the case of inertial fusion 
that, despite enormous investment, strange unexpected instabilities have meant that they did not achieve the 
results their big codes had predicted. That is a message for all to take on board!  Our computer codes need to 
contain all the relevant physics. If all the relevant physics is not yet known, then some risks must be taken. 
These can be minimised by incremental development where difficulties are solved one-by-one and by small 
increments rather than all together in a single big increment. The uniquely safe and inexhaustible nature of 
fusion power makes it such a prize that investors are quite willing to take risks. One conclusion for this 
meeting is that: &quot;To accelerate fusion we need to take some calculated risks.&quot;

<P>The second paper is by Tony Donné the Programme Manager of EUROfusion. It gives a systematic outline of 
the Eurofusion &quot;Roadmap&quot; and the eight &quot;missions&quot; that EUROfusion is aiming to address, such as heat-
exhaust systems, neutron resistant materials and tritium self-sufficiency, needed to design the European 
DEMO reactor. Donné stressed the need for integration of these, the involvement of industry, and for a 14 
MeV neutron source for materials testing.  

<P>Guenter Janeschitz&apos;s paper used his experience gained at ITER and from his leadership of the Karlsruhe 
International School on Fusion Technologies to take an alternative view of tokamak power plant design. His 
paper takes the view that the tokamak outer breeding wall, building construction and licensing costs tend to 
be independent of plasma size, so that larger sizes and powers are optimal. His paper does discuss shape 
effects in detail and suggests an ideal aspect ratio of 2.5
Yutaka Kamada has not submitted a paper, but he spoke of the new JET-sized low-temperature 
superconductor JapanTokamak-60cmSuperAdvanced JT-60SA. It should be ready by 2020 and will be able to 
increase the lead the Japanese already have in approaching higher triple products in non-tritium plasmas [25]. 
Some details are shown in table 2 and figures 17 and 18 from the official website [25].

<P>Since the 1957 ZETA experiments at Harwell, plasma instabilities have been the bugbear of fusion. Howard 
Wilson&apos;s paper gives us hope that fusion theory could help to mitigate their effects. He explained how &quot;the 
most compact fusion reactors will benefit from high confinement.&quot; He emphasized the different strategies for 
the development of fusion and their different balances of risk and speed.
       
<P>Ian Chapman’s paper speaks of the very exciting UKAEA scene at present including the role of JET and its 
programme in support of ITER. MAST upgrade is due to be running later this year and the meeting wished it 
good fortune!  We all have much to learn from their new superX divertor for carrying the external energy 
away, and ELM mitigation operations. We wish for record results from the coming JET D-T campaign in a 
year or so. I am sure the whole UK fusion community as represented here wants to work with you in making 
the most of these opportunities.
       
<P>The two papers by Hartmut Zohm and Alan Costley form a debate on tokamak size that comes to some 
conclusions. Both agree that toroidal field dependence is crucial to the debate. Both agree that smaller size 
does generally go with higher fields. Both agree that engineering constraints can limit performance with 
today&apos;s materials. The Costley side of the debate also considers aspect ratio A and elongation
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>k</SPAN>, as important 
variables, which Zohm agreed needs to be investigated further. Zohm recognised HTS magnets might permit 
smaller size, but felt improved performance would be needed.  Costley also points out that the beta-
independent versions of the ITER confinement time scalings – and it is now generally accepted that at reactor 
relevant low collisionalities the confinement time is independent of beta - lead to significantly lower fusion 
power for a given fusion gain.  Lower fusion power will aid the construction of smaller fusion tokamaks. 
       
<P>Melanie Windridge’&apos;s paper considers the opportunity given by High Temperature Superconducting magnets 
(HTS). These can operate in magnetic fields of up to 20 Tesla, have higher current density than conventional 
low temperature magnets and require less cryogenic cooling. This is the way forward proposed by Tokamak 
energy, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and MIT. The disadvantage of HTS at this stage is that it is not a 
mature technology, so not without risk and not cheap. That is why Tokamak Energy have set up an HTS team 
in Oxfordshire, where there is unrivalled experience in magnet technologies, to develop HTS techniques.
       
<P>Jon Menard&apos;s paper describes his Fusion Nuclear Science Facility with spherical tokamaks and HTS magnets. 
His paper gives the detailed quantitative analysis of the variation of performance with aspect ratio self-
consistently with elongation, which many at the meeting had been asking for. Designs with aspect ratio 
around two were possible but their confinement times remain an unsolved issue. The fusion community wish 
him good luck with this project and in getting NSTX -upgrade back running again. World-wide fusion 
projects are great, but we need additional different projects also. There is a considerable risk in putting all 
your eggs into one basket.
       
<P>Dennis Whyte&apos;s paper delighted us all with his news.  $50M of private money from Commonwealth Fusion 
Systems will be invested to develop HTS magnets and for detailed design of the Smallest Possible Affordable 
Robust Compact tokamak (SPARC). The fusion community congratulates him and the whole team for getting 
this project under way. We wish them good fortune.
       
<P>Elizabeth Surrey's paper concentrates on the engineering challenges of accelerated demonstrator systems 
relevant to a fusion power plant. A detailed discussion is given of the component systems relevant to a fusion 
power plant. Also discussed are the need to demonstrate tritium self-sufficiency, issues relating to the 
economic production of electricity, remote handling schemes, the control of the plasma, safety and licensing 
by a nuclear authority.  She stressed the need for an integrated approach to these, involving industry and 
considering the supply chain at an early stage. Computational engineering and verification would be 
important. Her paper did not dwell on the key engineering challenge of smaller tokamaks. These have a 
general problem of how the limited radial space available for the central column and its radiation shield can 
adequately reduce heat deposition and radiation damage.  
       
<P>George Smith gave us some answers to these questions. There are new materials such as the cemented 
tungsten carbides - familiar from tool steel cutting heads. They can combine high strength and toughness with 
very high temperature operations and good neutron and gamma shielding. His paper reviews the engineering 
properties of pure tungsten carbides, and treats in some detail the properties of the candidate cermet material, 
WC-FeCr. The problem of how to manufacture the large shield of this type required for a power plant remains 
open. 
       
<P>Nick Lopes Cardoso addressed the economic reasons that governments and utilities may invest in the 
Eurofusion road map power plant. He thought it impossible to introduce fusion power on the timescale 
envisaged by the Paris 2015 agreement on climate change. The rate of growth of the different energy markets 
like fission, wind and solar are shown to have been remarkably similar with a doubling time of around 2.5 
years. Energy is a market, and a very large one too! However growth rates will all depend on the product 
offered. He introduced a &quot;Valley of death&quot; when the time-scale for the return on capital in a power plant is 
much greater than the desired doubling time for growth. However if faster fusion can give us a modular 
power plant at the right cost and time-scale, industry will buy it and it could be implemented on the 
timescales considered as necessary by energy policy makers. The private investors to faster fusion are the 
proof of this.

<P>The meeting posed the question &quot;Can development of fusion power be accelerated?&quot; We have heard enough 
to understand that it can be accelerated, not by pursuing a single line of development alone, but by pursuing 
several new ideas in parallel, and especially those based on higher field, lower aspect ratio and lower power 
devices. In his final round up comments, Mike Zarnstoff gave us the good summary sentence: &quot;de-risk at 
minimum size&quot;.  

<P>In conclusion I would like to thank several people for making this meeting a success. First the organising 
committee, Jack Connor, Melanie Windridge, Dennis Whyte and Guenter Janeschitz for getting the 
programme together and constant support. The programme chairs, and especially Mike Zarnstoff in the last 
session, ensured that the discussions continued well, and that the whole meeting kept exactly to time.  Special 
thanks are due to Annabel Sturgess and all her helpers from the Society for organising the meeting so well and 
to Bailey Fallon for help with the preparation of the papers for publication in the proceedings.  Lastly thanks 
are due to all the participants for their interest in fusion and their excellent questions, the speakers who have 
educated us on their way to accelerating fusion, and my colleagues, Jack Connor, Melanie Windridge, Alan 
Costley and David Kingham for helpful comments on the paper.
