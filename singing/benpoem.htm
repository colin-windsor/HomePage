<H1>Ben's Poem written for SAS after Christ Church, Oxford</H1>
<P><HR>
<FONT SIZE=4>
<I> To all members of Schola Aquae Sulis who were at Oxford.
<BR>A mere thankyou would not suffice for all you did at Christchurch.</I>

<P>
At Oxford a choir did assemble,
<BR>From far and wide S.A.S dash,
<BR>And quickly they need to resemble
<BR>A cathedral style choir with panache.

<P>For all its a bit of a worry,
<BR>with its difficult music and chants,
<BR>Many practices too, with relentless to-do,
<BR>to deal with Bens harmonic slants.

<P>For Katie and Laura, 'mongst many
<BR>being new was enough of a shock.
<BR>But with A level grades just a few days away,
<BR>there was worry and need to take stock!


<P>To all, please, if Ben seems unloving,
<BR>inconsiderate, pushy and dumb,
<BR>He loves all his singers, and pleading
<BR>says, to Chester, nest summer, please come.

<P>He hopes you'll forgive his transgressions,
<BR>and think of him kindly, if time!
<BR>And despite his mistakes and his errors,
<BR>and his 'Go's at the alto line.

<P>Please see his intentions are honest,
<BR>maybe strange and disjoined and wiered,
<BR>But he loves every one of his singers,
<BR>and he hopes that he's not to be feared.

<P>So finally reading this ditty.
<BR>give a thought to the way I can better...
<BR>delight all my choir, with gusto and fire,
<BR>Use some paper and write me letter.
<P><HR></P>

<I>Later memories of the tour...</I>
<P>We hope you will remember well
<BR>the drinkies at the 'Bear',,
<BR>For S.A.S will long recall
<BR>that mystery sloping stair.

<P>The Crown, The Mitre, meals and beer,
<BR>rekindle memories fond;
<BR>Al fresco evenings on the grass
<BR>to seal our social bond.

<P>The chats, the thoughts of music past
<BR>of music yet to come;
<BR>The joys, the moments that went wrong,
<BR>catastrophies for some.

<P>Yet all these things just go to make
<BR>the trust and love we find,
<BR>Each time we meet to sing again,
<BR>to later leave behind.

<P>The singers come, the singers go,
<BR>the memories pass and fade;
<BR>But S.A.S. pursues its task,
<BR>and always makes the grade.

<P>I hope both singers new and old
<BR>and many undiscovered,
<BR>Will still come back and sing again,
<BR>voices and souls recovered,                   

<P>Discussing dress, the heat, the pubs
<BR>the ladies need for tea,
The Priory room, its quiet and space...
<BR>thoughts flooding back to me!

<P>The quad, Tom tower, the bowler hats
<BR>the sermons long and daunting,
<BR>The beauty of OUR Christchurch choir,
<BR>creating music haunting.

<P>Now as I sit, reflect alone,
<BR>on tour, on choir resiliant;
<BR>Remember S.A.S. is us,
<BR>You and the others...brilliant
