the Schola Aquae Sulis choir at Norwich Cathedral in 1999. It is part of a 
professionally made CD recorded that year.

<P>Singing gives Mo and I great joy with many friends in several choirs. <IMG 
align=left src="singing_files/gccbelleme.jpg"> 
<P>In about 1972 I joined the <A 
href="http://www.goringchamberchoir.org.uk/">Goring Chamber Choir</A> under its 
most musical conductor Andrew Mackay. It was under him that I became a reluctant 
tenor. In 1979 the choir went to Durham Cathedral starting its cathedral 
weekends that have continued ever since. Durham 1979, Chester 1980, Chartres and 
Lichfield 1981, Lincoln 1983, Salisbury 1984, Norwich 1985, Sees, Le Mans and 
Winchester 1986, Chichester 1987, York 1988, Exeter 1989, Hereford 1990, Wells 
1991, Beverley and Durham 1992, <A 
href="file:///C:/webtalktalk2/singing/93bury.htm">Bury St Edmonds 1993</A>. I 
left in 1994 just after the choir's trip to a music festival in Spain. The 
picture shows a twinning visit to Belleme in 1993. <IMG align=right 
src="singing_files/goringchurchchoirs.jpg"> 
<P>In the 1970s I helped with the Goring Church Sunday School alongside Liz 
Dowding and Mary Harding. Teaching the under-fives to sing, including my own 
children, tought me a great deal. In about 1978 most of the school joined the 
Church choir. Mary Seymour was choirmistress and Evelyn Fisher the excellent 
organist. I became choir leader in about 1985. We did some good singing 
especially Stainer's Crucifiction in 1991 and Bach's "Jesu Priceless Treasure" 
in 1994. I wrote several anthems for the choir and in 1985 my <A 
href="file:///C:/webtalktalk2/music/communion/communion.htm">Communion Service 
</A>for the 1980 Alternative Service Book" words. I left the choir in 1994 
handing over to Mo who had joined me as choir leader. The picture shows at the 
back, left to right, organist Evelyn Fisher, Diane Smith, John Gilford, Julia 
Slingo, Colin Windsor, Mo Watkins, Douglas Merry, Jenny Boyd, Malcolm Bates, 
Joanna Huhes, Alun Hughes, and in front, Elizabeth Ainsworth, Jill Tylor, Clare 
Nixon. <IMG

align=left src="singing_files/sinenomine.jpg"> 
<P>Very soon after Mo and I left Goring followed up an advert in the AERE news 
and joined David Dendy's "Sine Nomine" group. It met, and still meets, at 
David's house singing a nicely crafted mix from old favourates to sight reading, 
from mediaval madrigals to 20th Century, especially Finzi! In its heighday it 
gave several concerts church services each year. Now David's eyes are a problem 
and we sing for our own pleasure, always followed by a delicious feast from 
David's wife Ann. <IMG alt="The SAS choir at York in 2004" align=right

<P>In 1997, <A href="file:///C:/webtalktalk2/singing/www.saschoir.org">Schola 
Aquae Sulis</A>, a group of about 30 singers came to Christ Church Oxford for 
their annual week-long Cathedral sing. They were short of tenors and Colin and 
Mo joined to help and have sung with them ever since. The conductor Ben Cliffe 
composes our responses and chants and even <A

Choir</A> a skilled group founded by Martin Hall, now the emeritus director in 
1979. It is ably managed by chairman David Clover. The present musical director 
is superb singer and organist Matthew O'Donovan - a young teacher at Eton. The 
choir meets about twice a year. We have sung at Bristol and Chester (2005),

src="singing_files/2apdorcs.jpg"> 
<P>A fellow tenor at that CCC visit to Bristol in 2005 was Tim Cook and he asked 
Mo and I to join the "Two-a-part" group centered on Dorchester. It has a most 
pleasant schedule. We meet every Tuesday in his ample conservatory with glasses 
of red wine before us and sing a great variety of music. Sometimes it is church 
music, especially for weddings which are frequent, and a nice little earner. 
Sometimes it is parties, or shows, or entertainment. The picture shows us at the 
George Inn Dorchester , doing Christmas carols. The members shown are Tim Cook, 
Colin, Penny Budgeon, Alison Bruckner, Mo, Janita Good, Terry Chipperfield and 
John Cornelius. <IMG alt="Streatley Church Choir in 2005" align=left 
src="singing_files/streatley05choir.jpg"> 
<P>Last and not least must be mentioned Streatley Church Choir where Colin sung 
most Sundays and Mo had been the Choir Leader and organist between 2001 and 
2011. It is like a happy family. Many of us have our problems and we all look 
after one another and sing lustily together to forget our woes. Our task is to 
lead the music with hymns, psalms and canticles, but we have occasional bigger 
ventures. We did Stainer's Crucifiction in 2003 , an Advent Concert in 2005, an 
Epiphany Concert in 2007 and a Rogation Concert in 2008. 
<P>Our church is affiliated to the Royal School of Church Music, Oxford branch. 
One of its activities is an annual <A 
href="file:///C:/webtalktalk2/singing/rscm/rscm.htm">Choral Festival</A> with 
hundreds of singers from the neighbourhood. 
<P>I am building a list of <A 
href="file:///C:/webtalktalk2/singing/repertoire.htm">Cathedral music</A> I have 
sung.
