<P>Click on the "play" button to hear a snippet from "O Lord look down" sung by the 
Schola Aquae Sulis choir at Norwich Cathedral in 1999. 
It is part of a professionally made
CD recorded that year.

<P>Singing gives Mo and I great joy with many friends in several choirs.

<P>In about 1972 I joined the 
<A HREF="http://www.goringchamberchoir.org.uk">Goring Chamber Choir</A> 
under its most musical 
conductor Andrew Mackay. It was under him that I became a reluctant tenor.

In 1979 the choir went to Durham Cathedral starting its cathedral weekends 
that have continued ever since.

I left in 1994 just after the choir's trip to a music festival in Spain.

<P>In the 1970s I helped with the Goring Church Sunday School alongside Liz Dowding and Nancy Harding. 

Teaching the under-fives to sing, including my own children, tought me a great deal. 
In about 1978 
most of the school joined the Church choir. 
Mary Seymour was choirmistress and Evelyn Fisher the excellent 
organist. 
I became choir leader in about 1985. We did some good singing especially Stainer's Crucifiction
 
in 1991 and Bach's "Jesu Priceless Treasure" in 1994. I wrote several anthems for the choir and 
in 1985 my

words. 
I left the choir in 1994 handing over to Mo who had joined me as choir leader.

<P> In 1994, soon after Mo and I left Goring we followed up an advert in the AERE news and joined 

David Dendy's "Sine Nomine" group. It met until his sad death in 2013 at David's house singing a nicely

crafted mix from old favourates to sight reading, from mediaval madrigals to 20th Century, especially


Finzi! In its heighday it gave several concerts church services each year. Later David's eyes were 
a problem 
and we sang for our own pleasure, always followed by a delicious feast from David's wife Ann.

<P>In 1997, <A HREF= "https://www.saschoir.org"> Schola Aquae Sulis</A>, 
a group of about 30 singers 
came to Christ Church Oxford for their annual 
week-long Cathedral sing. They were short of tenors 
and Colin and Mo joined to help and have sung with
 them ever since. The conductor Ben Cliffe 
composes our responses and chants and even

<IMG SRC="cccnorwich07.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="The CCC choir at Norwich in 2007"> 

<P>In another temporary shortage of tenors, we joined the 

<A HREF= "www.ccchoir.org.uk">Cathedral Chamber Choir</A> 
a skilled group founded by Martin Hall,
 now the emeritus director in 1979. 
It is ably managed by chairman David Clover. The present musical 
director is superb 
singer and organist Matthew O'Donovan - a young teacher at Eton.

The choir meets about twice a year. We have sung at Bristol and Chester (2005), 
Exeter and 
St Albans (2006),

<IMG SRC="2apdorcs.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="The 2-a-part choir group in Dorchester"> 


<P>A fellow tenor at that CCC visit to Bristol in 2005 was Tim Cook and he asked Mo and I to 
join the
 "Two-a-part" group centered on Dorchester. It has a most pleasant schedule. 
We meet every Tuesday 
in his ample conservatory with glasses of red wine before us 
and sing a great variety of music.
 Sometimes it is church music, especially for 
weddings which are frequent, and a nice little earner.

Sometimes it is parties, or shows, or entertainment. The picture shows us at the 
George Inn Dorchester
, doing Christmas carols. 
The members shown are Tim Cook, Colin, Penny Budgeon, Alison Bruckner,

Mo, Janita Good, Terry Chipperfield and John Cornelius.



<IMG SRC="streatley05choir.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Streatley Church Choir in 2005"> 

<P>Last and not least must be mentioned Streatley Church Choir where Colin sung 
most Sundays and Mo had been the Choir Leader and organist between 2001 and 2011. 
It is like a happy family. 
Many of us have our problems and we
 all look after one another and sing lustily 
together to forget our woes. Our task is to lead the 
music with hymns, psalms and canticles, 
but we have occasional bigger ventures. We did Stainer's Crucifiction in 2003 ,
an Advent Concert in 2005, an Epiphany Concert in 2007 and a Rogation Concert 
in 2008.

<P>Through its affiliation to the Royal School of Church Music, Oxford branch, we sangin its annual <A HREF= "rscm/rscm.htm">Choral Festival</A> with hundreds of singers from the neighbourhood.

<P>Now in East Hagbourne

<P>I am building a list of <A HREF= "repertoire.htm">Cathedral music</A> I have sung.
