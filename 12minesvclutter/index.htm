The ability of RASCAN holographic radar to distinguish buried objects through their shape and texture has been investigated. RASCAN produces data 
that can be processed into a two-dimensional subsurface image suitable for object identification either by eye or by computer, where scanned 
receptive fields can be used for object location and trained neural networks for object identification. With the eventual objective of 
distinguishing buried antipersonnel landmines from battlefield clutter, the five objects considered were: a simulated mine, a small unexploded shell, 
a crushed aluminium can, a short length of barbed wire and a stone. In the first experiments, the objects were buried in fine, dry sand so that 
the object classification methods could be tested in the absence of the inevitable false alarm features arising from rough and uneven surfaces 
and soil inhomogeneity. Training data were collected from 11 scans, each containing these five objects at random positions and depths. 
The simulated mines were identified with 100% success, with zero false alarms in both training and testing. The clutter test objects 
were identified with around a 75% success rate and about 15% false alarms. An unseen validation image correctly identified the mine and three of 
the four clutter objects.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5><P>Holographic radar works by comparing the phase of a sinusoidal field reflected from a buried object and from a ground surface reflection with the 
internal reference phase of the transmitting antenna. It is sensitive to small variations in depth or permittivity contrast but, because of the 
phase periodicity, absolute depths are undetermined. On a processed RASCAN plan-view image, objects can often be identified directly by their 
shape and texture. This is a great simplification compared with the B-scan compilation and migration analysis needed for impulse radar.

<P>The inspiration for this work is humanitarian demining and, in particular, the problem of distinguishing mines from &apos;clutter&apos;, 
or harmless battlefield rubbish. Records (for example from Cambodia<sup>(1)</sup>) show that over 99% of a deminer&apos;s time may be spent removing 
clutter or harmless items. The traditional metal detector and probing sapper spike are slow and dangerous, especially with modern plastic mines, 
with one deminer casualty per 1000 mines recovered<sup>(2)</sup>. Impulse radar with a high centre frequency (1 - 2 GHz) has long been used for 
mine detection and some specialised systems are now in routine use<sup>(3,4)</sup>. However, they remain relatively expensive and suffer from soil-antenna 
reverberations, requiring filtering to avoid a dead zone at very shallow (up to 50 mm) depths<sup>(5,6)</sup>. The advantages of impulse radar are 
high axial resolution and good penetration in soil due to the high peak power and time-varying gain amplification of the later (deeper) 
reflections. These advantages have stimulated the development of dual-sensor systems combining impulse radar with a metal detector. 
Daniels<sup>(7)</sup> reviews this technology for landmine detection and defines the key features for successful field systems. It is likely that 
different environments will require different approaches, and the approach reported here will not be universally applicable.

<P>This study considers an alternative radar technology: holographic radar with high-frequency (4 GHz) continuous wave signals and baseband 
demodulation circuitry. The system is designed to operate in the near field with an antenna footprint of about half of the signal wavelength. 
This implies a spatial resolution of about 10 mm at 4 GHz in dry soil. The utility of holographic radar has been demonstrated for 
different targets at different depths<sup>(8,9)</sup> to establish the penetration depth and resolution metrics. The RASCAN system has two 
receivers with parallel and cross polarisation to ensure the detection of arbitrarily oriented elongated objects. The 4 
GHz RASCAN-4/4000 is capable of recording phase variations due to dielectric contrasts for targets buried up to one wavelength in 
soil (~75 mm for a dry soil with phase velocity 1 x 108 m/s). Deeper objects can be detected, at the expense of a decreasing plan-view 
resolution, by decreasing the operating frequency to 2 GHz, as demonstrated in the RASCAN-4/2000 version.

<P>Research on the RASCAN system for demining has been conducted for several years<sup>(10,11,12)</sup>. Of course, as stated by
MacDonald <I>et al</I><sup>(1)</sup> and known as a practical matter by deminers themselves, &apos;no single mine detection technology can operate effectively 
against all mine types in all settings&apos;, and the principal limitation of radar is its limited effective penetration in damp soils 
(due to attenuation) or inhomogeneous soils (due to scattering). Soil characterisation for conventional radar has been extensively 
investigated(13). However, holographic radar presents slightly different problems, which have not been so well investigated. 
In particular, soil surface unevenness and exposed stones can give strong signals. This is an area of active research. Work to be
reported at the 2012 Ground Penetrating Radar Conference in Shanghai shows that undulations and projections in the sand surface of 
around 15 mm spread gave interference signals that were strong enough to disguise the signal from a buried stimulant mine. However, 
placing a smoothed layer of suitable sand over the uneven surface mitigated the problem and revealed the mine. In this case, the amount 
of new sand corresponded to an average depth of about 6 mm, or 6 litres per square metre of area. This amount is small enough to help 
in exceptional cases, although it would not be practical for all situations. The holographic radar signals from an uneven surface 
could be corrected by, for example, an ultrasonic range finder scanned along with the radar sensor. Quadrature receivers may allow 
focusing of buried objects <SUP>(14)</SUP>. The problems have yet to be solved but progress is being made. However, in dry 
homogeneous soils, the present study suggests that holographic radar works well enough that it could provide a possible 
contribution to the clutter problem after further development. A sophisticated approach to detection and classification 
using principal component analysis is described in Daniels&apos; Ground Penetrating Radar <SUP>(15)</SUP> and in Miao <I>et al</I><SUP>(16)</SUP>. 
Other approaches based on neural networks have been applied to impulse radar images using pre-processing and feature extraction 
to reduce the dimensionality of the training data<SUP>(17,18,19,20)</SUP>.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5><p>
For these experiments the following objects were buried:
<BR>1. A simulated plastic mine consisting of a cylindrical plastic sweet container, with 80 mm diameter and 20 mm height, 
filled with granulated sugar (relative dielectric of 3.0) to simulate the properties of the plastic explosive filling 
of an actual mine (relative dielectric of 2.9<SUP>(21)</SUP>). This produced no signal at all on a metal detector.
<BR>2. A piece of unexploded ordnance (UXO) consisting of an inert brass shell and steel projectile with a length of 130 mm 
and a diameter of 21 mm. It weighed 100 g and gave a strong metal detector signal.
<BR>3. A bit of metal trash. This was a &apos;Coca-Cola&apos; can that was crushed into an irregular shape about 100 mm by 80 mm. 
Its weight was 15 g and it also gave a strong metal detector signal.
<BR>4. A piece of rusty barbed wire about 130 mm long and bent into a slight curve. It weighed 10 g and gave a weak metal detector signal.
<BR>5. An irregular stone of about 120 x 75 x 40 mm and weighing 500 g. It gave no metal detector signal.
<BR>For each of 12 similar scans, the objects were buried with different positions, orientations and depths. Figure 1 
shows the five objects lying above the sand in one randomised configuration. Objects were spaced so their reflected 
waves did not interfere at depths of up to about 75 mm, mimicking the small depth typical of many buried landmines.

is the Rascan control box. This connects to a 12 V power supply (not in the photo) and the laptop which 
shows the image raster-by-raster in real time. </p></B></font>

<P>The RASCAN system<SUP>(22)</SUP> has five distinct frequencies from 3.6 to 4.0 GHz, with both parallel and perpendicular 
polarisations so that the raw data appear in 10 images. The scans were made by hand using the set-up in Figure 2. 
The sandpit was a square plastic garden tray, with dimensions of 570 x 570 x 75 mm deep, filled to the brim with sand. 
On the surface of the sand was a thin (~1 mm) plastic sheet on which parallel lines were ruled at 10 mm intervals. 
A line at right angles determined the starting point of each raster scan line. Each complete scan took about 
4 min to perform manually. The scanning method and time are not limitations since the antenna can be mounted 
on a mechanical scanner for field deployment.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><B><P>Figure 3. The raw data collected for Run 140, whose objects before they were buried 
were shown in Figure 1. The two columns represent the parallel and cross polarizations, and the phase of the product 
of the reflected and incident signals on an arbitrary scale with light the positive phase and dark the negative phase.  
Images are 400 mm x 480 mm with pixel size 10 mm. </p></B></font>

<P>Figure 3 shows the raw RASCAN images for the object layout in Figure 1. The background phase varies slightly 
with the frequency and polarisation and the object images differ slightly. For example, the simulated mine at the 
bottom left shows as a white circle in most of the parallel images, but as a complex striped image in the cross 
polarisation. The human eye finds these 10 distinct images confusing as there is no single image that can be 
associated with our five objects. Automated image processing has a similar difficulty, since there is 
no &apos;template&apos; that can be matched to unknown objects in test images.

<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>3. The ‘summed modulus’ display</P></B></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5><P>
The images in Figure 3 contain useful information, but are not conducive to automated interpretation.  
To facilitate automated image analysis, the 10 images of Figure 3 have been combined into a single image 
using the &apos;summed modulus&apos; described by Windsor et al. <SUP>(23)</SUP>. In this procedure, the absolute 
values of the phase signal amplitude are summed less the average background phase over the whole image. 
In mathematical terms the composite signal <I>S(x,y)</i> at positions <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> in the image is 

<P><I> S(x,y) = <span style='font-family:Symbol' SIZE=5>S</span></font><SUB>i=1,5, j=1,2</SUB>   
|A<SUB>i,j</SUB>(x,y) - Bi,j | </I><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>(1)</DIV>

<P>where <I>A<SUB>i,j</SUB>(x,y)</I> is the signal amplitude at position <I>(x,y)</i> at frequency <i>i</I> 
and polarization  <I>j</I> and  <I>B<SUB>i,j</SUB></i> is the background amplitude of each image averaged 
over all pixels. The summation runs over the five frequencies and the two polarizations. 
The resulting image is shown in Figure 4, and the &apos;background&apos; appears generally dark with significant 
deviations of either phase showing as light. The raw images of figure 3 remain difficult to classify 
either by eye or computer. The parallel mine simulant images may be circular but the cross images at 
3.6 an 3.7 GHz appear as light and dark ellipsoids, while those at higher frequencies have an irregular 
&apos;texture&apos; of indeterminate shape. Both eye and computer have difficulty assimilating the ten distinct 
images presented to them. In the single image of figure 4 the complications are averaged out and the 
circular mine simulant appears as a light circular image on a dark background on all the measured scans. 
Both eye and computer now have an image for each type of object which, although slightly more blurred 
than the original raw images, can be uniquely associated with that object. Classification becomes practicable.

In the summed modulus image (Figure 4), the simulated mine and the four clutter objects appear as distinct 
shapes and textures that the human eye or computer can learn to locate and classify. The simulated mine has 
a high amplitude and round shape. The squashed can has a texture different from the mine and an outline that 
mimics the shape of the can. The unexploded shell maintains its elongated shape. The arc of the barbed wire 
has lost the stripes seen in Figure 4. The stone is low amplitude and irregular in shape. These images can 
easily be interpreted by eye. Figure 5 shows the summed modulus images from runs 139, 138 and 137 and the 
reader is invited to identify the mine.

<P>The method for automatically locating objects within the images 
employs a scanned &apos;receptive field&apos; followed by a neural network<SUP>(24)</SUP>,
as used previously by the authors to locate defects in steel welds. An illustrative diagram of the method 
is shown in Figure 6.

<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="mvcfig6.jpg">
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><B><P>Figure 6. An illustrative diagram of the methods used by our eyes and in this paper. 
The eye sweeps over the image using its central region, the macula, to search for areas of interest. 
Our visual cortex then analyses the image. In our method a receptive field (illustrated here with 3x3 pixels 
sweeps over the image in a raster scan. Local 3x3 pixel areas of interest are presented to a neural network 
trained to recognize particular features such as circles and lines in this example. </p></B></font>

<P>A small area (for example 11 x 11 pixels) is swept across the image searching for a high signal amplitude. 
The best location for object centres was achieved by sweeping a pyramidal amplitude profile over the image. 
The receptive field position with the highest summed weighted amplitude within the image was extracted and 
saved for further analysis and the amplitude within the receptive field area replaced by the average amplitude 
over the image. The position with the next highest weighted amplitude is then found and so on until all 
positions with weighted amplitudes above some specified minimum amplitude have been found. An example of 
this is given in Figure 7 for run 139 (shown on the left in Figure 5).


<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="mvcfig7.jpg">

yellow (center: mine), green (top left: shell), blue (bottom left: wire) and magenta (top right: stone) 
</p></B></font>

<P>If the receptive field is made too small (for example 9 x 9 pixels), then the larger objects, such as 
the squashed can at the bottom right, are not completely removed by replacement with the average amplitude 
in the receptive field area. On the other hand, if it is too large, then a central region containing the 
object is surrounded by background and the network complexity is wasted.


<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>5. Object classification using a neural network</P></B></FONT>
<P>The next step was to collect a series of receptive field images for use in training and optimising 
a neural network. Before each scan, the five objects; mine, shell, can, wire and stone were placed in 
the sand at random positions, orientations, and depths with the actual positions noted. For each run, 
all of the 11x11 receptive fields containing known objects were saved to form the training, testing, 
and validation images for the neural net.  For six runs, not all the objects were located by the receptive 
field, leaving 54 receptive field images from known object types to be used in the analysis. 

<P>Neural networks have been described by Bishop <SUP>(25)</SUP>. In this case, they provide a non-linear 
mapping between the 121 pixels of an object image, and a series of outputs, which represent each of
the target types to be classified. An example of a classic Rumelhart network <SUP>(26)</SUP> is shown in Figure 8. 
The network has three layers, an input layer, which carries the pixel amplitudes of the receptive field images, 
a hidden layer, and an output layer representing the objects to be classified.

<P>To determine the optimal neural network, the available data were divided into training, testing, 
and validation fractions. The training data were used to find the network best predicting the output 
target values from given inputs. The test data were used to optimize the complexity of the neural 
network to minimize a performance metric. The validation data, being previously unseen by the 
optimization process, were used as a blind test of the network.  In this study, just the 5 images 
from Run 140 are used as validation data.

<P>The 49 training and testing images are shown in Figure 9. Note that the simulated mines consistently 
display round shape and high contrast. The shell and wire have distinct elongate shape, with the wire 
being weaker and curved. The can has a speckled texture, due to its crumpled surface. This set of 
49 images was randomly divided into 70% training (37 images) and 30% testing data (19 images). 
The targets for the five outputs were defined as (1 0 0 0 0), (0 1 0 0 0), (0 0 1 0 0), (0 0 0 1 0) 
and (0 0 0 0 1) for the mine, shell, can, wire and stone respectively.  During training, the network 
weights are adjusted to reduce the residual given by the sum of the squared differences between the 
current network output values and the known targets, summed over all classes.   Generally, the 
greater the number of hidden units, the greater number of adjustable weights, the better the fit 
of the outputs to their targets, and the lower the training residual. This may not be true for the 
test residual if there is over-parameterization or &apos;over-fitting&apos;. As with least squares fitting 
in two dimensions, a high number of parameters may fit the training data well, but the test data 
poorly. Closely fit training data may suggest a spurious precision.


<P>After training, the test data were presented to the network and the performance defined by the 
percentage of correct identifications and the percentage of false alarms. The network was 
optimized by varying the number of hidden nodes as illustrated in Figure 10. An optimal 
performance (maximum detection and minimum false alarms) was obtained for ~12 hidden units.

<P>In the dry sand used in this study, 4 GHz holographic radar provides clear subsurface imaging 
with a resolution of about a centimetre; sufficient to distinguish object shape by eye or by 
machine image analysis. The neural network approach for the simulated gave 100% identification 
with no false alarms, while the clutter object tests yielded on average 82% identification and 
16% false alarms. Successful validations were achieved with a mine simulant and clutter scan and 
with a scaled scan of an inert PPM-2. Further tests are planned with less favourable soils and 
other clutter and minimum-metal mines.
