<P>Faced with a large pad and with Biro in hand,
at long last I attempt to recall my past years, as requested by you, Colin
dear. In so doing I have mentally relived those years.</p>

I know very little of the life of my mother,
Emily Rayment, except that her father was a teacher and she herself a pupil,
then teacher at Beddington, Surrey, a small church school. She was married at
18, and had 8 children of which I was 5th.</p>

<P>I was born on May 18th 1908, at Mitcham,
Surrey, in a white house over-looking the Green. At the age of three weeks I
was taken to a thatched roof cottage at Burgate Cross, a hamlet near
Fordingbridge, Hants. My great grandmother had &quot;Yew Tree Cottage&quot;
built for her on the main road to Salisbury. The huge tree from which it had
its name is, I am told, mentioned in the Domesday Book, but I never saw it. 
My grandfather died early
and my grandmother brought up my father George Rayment and his sister, Eliza,
from an early age. My grandmother died in February 1908, and was interred in
the family vault with her husband at Ilford Cemetery in Essex. I am told that
it is near the grave of Karl Marx. My sisters, Kathleen and Phyllis have
visited the vault, but I have not. She left several annuities and a sum of
money to be paid to each offspring of my father and of his sister at the age of
21 years. My father's sister was Mrs Eliza Leddy and lived at Weymouth. He had
several daughters, but I never met them. Brother Sidney met them once. 
My grandmother owned a considerable area of
watercress beds on the opposite side of the road from the house. There was a
fresh spring well from which we fetched water, for use when bunching the
watercress for markets at Salisbury and Bournemouth. Beyond the beds was the
river Avon, more meadows and fields and, in the far distance, the outskirts of
the New Forest. One of my earliest recollections is that from our bedroom we
could look across at night and see the light from the fires of gypsies. By day
they would try to sell their ware to local inhabitants. My mother always found
some food - cakes or bread, so that they did not leave empty handed! </p>

<p><i>Yew Tree Cottage with Ray in 1951</i></p>

<p>Yew Tree Cottage had only cess-pool sanitation.
The toilet was outside across the yard, and if dark we had to take a lighted
candle! Oil was used for cooking and it was lit by paraffin oil. There was a
big kitchen range, and in other rooms, coal and wood fires. There were two
dogs, chickens, bantams, and ducks and at Christmas my mother would fatten up
turkey. I remember how I loved the smell of some special food they had. We had
two horses, one for pulling the cart, and one for the light &quot;trap&quot;
carriage. At the rear, there was a big yard with sheds for the carts. There
were brick-built stables, with stairs up to a loft where apples and other
produce was stored. There were other sheds to do with the watercress business.
My father would drive into Salisbury on market day with one of the family and I
always remember the smell of horses, mingled with the lovely aroma form a nearby
baker's shop. </p>

<p> I was about 4 when I started school. It was a
walk of at least 3/4 mile away to the next village called Breamore. Sometimes I
had a lift in a milk cart going into Breamore Station, where there was a single
line railway to Salisbury. The station master had several daughters, and all
had names of flowers, except one who was called &quot;Holly&quot;. I thought it
a beautiful name. I loved it at school. There were just two sections, for younger and older pupils. I mostly
remember the harmonium, and the dust that arose when the pedals were used, and
the end of term entertainments. We had our drill to music, with smooth wooden
objects, with a brass bell at each end clutched firmly in our small hands.
Every year as Christmas approached, we all took part in a concert. This was my
introduction to the Boards! I remember
vividly a sketch called &quot;Dolly's Doctor&quot;. The Head Master, a Mr
Blunden, had a son my age, Arthur. The stage set was a table on which was a cloth,
a plate with a slice of cake, some of which had been eaten. He had come to see
my dolly, and thought the cake on the table was the cause of its trouble so
tasted it and continued until it was all gone. Everyone but me was
laughing. Another show included about seven
or so older girls in nightdresses and holding candles, with me in the centre
doing likewise, they all went off stage in two's - one at each end - blowing
out their candles as they went leaving me on my own with candle still alight. I
cannot remember my words, but I do remember a song - and could sing it now:</p>

<p>The school bell is ringing so loudly ding-dong
<P>I heard it I know as I sauntered along,
<p>But the road is so crooked, I couldn't walk straight
<p>I shall be in a fix for I'm sure to be late.
<P>I had met a big boy and he bothered me so.
<P>He laid hands on my arm and he wouldn't let go.
<p>So I boxed both his ears and he looked such a fool
<P>And said, &quot;you are the very worst girl in the school!&quot

<p><i>My parents, George and Emily Rayment:</i></p>

<p>My father was rarely spoken of in terms of
affection but, since I have reached old age, I find lots that were good. One
example was when I was about 3 to 4 years old. Grace had a birthday party, on
August 9th. I had been dressed in a clean pinafore. There had been rain and
lots of apples had fallen off the trees and I collected them in my pinny - for
which I received a smacking and cried. My father picked me up and said,
&quot;You are too young to know any better,&quot; and comforted me. He played
the accordion well and loved me to play, in later years, the Sankey and Moody
hymns from the Salvation Army book such as &quot;Let the blessed sunshine
in!&quot; He was very well liked all through his life despite the upset he
caused through drinking. Great-grandmother had left him an annuity which was
paid to him twice a year, at the end of June and at Christmas. Hence our
Christmases were always disrupted. He would treat all his pals as well as
himself. It was not all his fault, I feel now. When he was a young man, ale was
the staple drink, I am told. Also I am sure there were difficulties unrelated
to drink. They had 8 children, I was the 5th but we were never a close family.
Grace and I always got on well, Sidney and Ted were great pals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<img src="eva.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT"></td>
<p><i>Sister Eva</i></p>


<p>I clearly remember when a new piano arrived at
our house, covered with a Hessian trimmed with red braiding. Sister Grace
started having lessons from a Miss Bland in Fordingbridge. My father always
encouraged any musical interest, and we all, at appropriate ages, received
lessons. The three boys sang in church choirs. Grace tried to learn the violin
which Elizabeth now plays so well. Kath and I had a period when we sang duets
which I played for, and earned 2 guineas each at Masonic dinners. My second
sister Eva, met and was married to an excellent baritone who was in Beddington
Church choir when I was about 13 or 14, and I accompanied him in songs that
later George sang. Eva sadly died from peritonitis. She was expecting a baby.
Frank joined the army as soon as he left school, travelled abroad, and when he
was 21 emigrated to Australia having received his legacy from GG. Sidney and
Teddy, divided by two and a half years, did everything together. When each had
a motor-bike, they met two girls, sisters, and the sisters each married a
brother. Sid joined a paint making firm, after leaving the army (1914-18) and
did very well, and was quite an artist in his way. He and Dorrie, his wife,
often came to see us in later years. They had, still have for Dorrie, a caravan
at Corton, on the east coast. For several years Dorrie's brother has driven her
down to see us and I'm very fond of her. Teddy became an electrician with his
own business. </p>

<p>Which leaves sister Kath. Mother used to say that &quot;Kitty&quot;, as she was
called, was such a good baby but that I was anything but! She was probably
right. I like to think that I worked off my tantrums at an early age, making me
less aggressive in later years. Kath was very good at school, particularly so
with figures. She eventually got a job as cashier at Sainsbury's Sutton,
Surrey. We were living at Carshalton them. Later she went to other branched
auditing. During one such audit she met, and fell in love with a manager, no
less, but nothing came of it. From my early teens I was always told to
&quot;take Kitty with you.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Brother Teds wedding:</i></p>

<p>At the outbreak of war in 1914, I remember
swinging on our big iron gate and watching soldiers marching along towards
Salisbury. I also remember being at a funeral of a soldier in Fordingbridge and
the firing of guns as a salute. But I remember very little else until it was
decided that we were to return to
London. When I arrived at Mitcham Junction, surrounded by open common land and
fields I was sorely disappointed at first. We stayed at Beddington with my
mother's step sister Aunt Jinny. The surname was Leach. I cannot remember the
house, but they kept a dog on a chain at the rear entrance.</p>

<img src="young.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT"></td>
<p><i>The Rev A.D.Young, priest in charge at St Andrews, Carshalton in 1922</i></p>

<p>We were only there for a short time before
moving to a wooden semi-detached house in Green Wrythe Lane, Carshalton. We
went to school at Hackbridge but later transferred to Camden road School at
Carshalton. I was picked out for singing and drawing, but really wanted to be
good at netball! My teacher was Miss Carr, the Head Mrs Legg. I remember Empire
Day Country dancing in Carshalton Park. My mother would not let me sit for a
scholarship to Wallington Grammar School, and I left school at 14 years. My
schooldays were happy. I suppose I had average ability but often had to sing on
my own and my drawings were often pinned up. We also had trips to Crystal
palace, and every year to Mitcham Fair.</p>

<p>From the time we moved to Carshalton, probably
about 1918, we young ones went to a small church St Andrews. There were various
activities there in which I took part. &quot;The Band of Hope&quot;
(anti-strong drink), a knitting class whose output went to the &quot;heathens
in far-off countries&quot;, and each year we had a Christmas show. I usually
had a part. A concert was arranged for an adult society and I was asked to sing
soprano in a 4-part harmony arrangement of Negro songs which I thoroughly
enjoyed. About the age of 14, I started to play tennis with church friends, and
also to look for a job.</p>

<img src="ray+phy1923.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT"></td>
<p><i>Ray (left) and Phyllis about 1923</i></p>


<p>Jobs were difficult to get, but Kath was
working in a box factory and through her I was taken on. Staff cuts and &quot;last in, first out,&quot; meant that I
was only there a few months. I found myself a job in at a &quot;silk&quot;
factory - they printed designs on various articles like tablecloths, with a
mixture of colours. The river Wandle ran alongside and I found it not
unpleasant. I helped with the packing. A forewoman took an interest in me and
whilst out walking one day, I saw here in the garden and she said I was in the
wrong job. I had brains and should use them and suggested the Post Office or
Civil Service. She sent for particulars and gave them to my mother who took me
to London for an exam, a medical and an interview. The outcome was that I
became a Girl Probationer in the Civil Service and was sent to the Hop
Telephone Exchange near London Bridge.</p>

<p>I remember getting up in the early hours to
walk to Hackbridge were we caught the &quot;workman's&quot; train to London
laden with an unlimited supply of food for ourselves and the animals at the
zoo. </p>

<p>There were two new girls, Kathleen Cross and
me. At the exchange I often had to go behind the switchboard to deliver forms
etc to the engineers, and one, named Arthur Preston was particularly friendly.
He was very much in love with a girl who lived at Beer in Devon. Remember he
was, to me, quite old, and I just a schoolgirl. We talked music and I was
invited to his home at Rayner's Pak near Wimbledon. They were a lovely family,
Ernest his brother, and his parents. We played duets and had singing sessions
and I was treated as one of the family, of a loving family such as I had never
known. Shakespeare, in Hamlet, speaks of the &quot;Divinity that shapes our
ends&quot; and this period played a part. Miss Legg was the Principal at the
Exchange and she helped me when I was working for exams. For two afternoons each week we went to the
&quot;Post Office Day Continuation School&quot; at London Wall, and I loved it.
We had the letters on our hatbands in red. The history master was Loman Loads.
I passed my exams well up and was later given a prize, &quot;David
Copperfield&quot; at County Hall. I was taught, believe it or not, by a Miss
Victoria Rayment, no relation though. She was a dear lovely person and took me
out and about. An exam at the end of a year placed me up near the top and I was
posted to the Money Order Department at Holloway - a long journey from
Carshalton. I was advised to put in for a transfer to the City, which I did the
first day there.</p>

<p>On December 2nd 1925, I started work at the
Money Order Department, at Manor Gardens Holloway. My first meeting with Bunty
was on my first day when we sat in a huge waiting room looking at each other,
and have been friends ever since. Winnie Amas (Foster) came with me. Our
supervisor was a Miss Boote and we did tease her, but I'm sure she was fond of
us. Whilst there, Winnie, Marjorie Bennett and I had a holiday in Switzerland,
on Lake Lucerne. Winnie and I went to a dance on a small island, with tiled
surface for dancing and met a chap call Robert, who was an official to do with
exercising, and was always around where we bathed. It was a wonderful holiday,
quite near the cathedral. Our room, on the first floor, had a balcony
over-looking the lake and wisteria growing in the open French windows with
lovely scent, which permeated our rooms. On Corpus Christ there was a
procession of clergy and small girls in white and an alter at the top of the
cathedral step where a service was held. My first trip up a mountain was
unforgettable. The views from Pilatus held me spell-bound. I corresponded with
Robert for quite a while. He had a sister married to an Englishman, who lived
in Sevenoaks! He wanted me to spend another holiday in Lucerne, and said his
sister would accompany me as a chaperon.</p>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>

<p>Around this time I had become friendly with some
other teenagers from Wallington. I sometimes went to Wallington parish Church
and one Arthur Gilbert, a draughtsman, also a Civil Servant attached himself to
me. He was a Rover scout, attached to the church and asked me to accompany a
concert they were doing, which I did. He had a friend, Desmond Pride, to whom I
was introduced, as he was very musical. With the intention of finding out what
I'd like as a birthday present. Arthur did a series of &quot;pin&quot; people - our group -, which
I still have in my Tangiers purse bag. He also painted the lychgate of
Beddinton Church, where sister Grace was married to Graham Boyd, a rubber
plantation manager form Jahore, and gave it to her as a wedding present. To
return to the Wallington crowd, after a couple of concerts I was asked to sing
solos and eventually Des took over the accompanying and sister Kath and myself
with songs and duets and a soubrette, a rather fat and very versatile third
lady. After a few cocerts, Duffy Des's mother took over and his father Sid
Pride produced. He also made up most of our material - sketches, monologues
etc. He was a Fleet Street illustrator of magazines etc. he did a sketch of a
&quot;Black-bird singing&quot;, and also one of me in my autograph album.</P>
 
<td align="right"><img src="des2.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT"</td>
<p><i>Bob, Des, Ray, Jack and Madge at Selsey in 1930</i></p>


<p>By the time Arthur G had bought my much-used Beethoven sonatas and had accepted
that Des had I were good friends. We must all have such happy memories of those
days. Rehersals at the Prides, parties in plenty - particualrly New Year's Eve
as Des's birthday is on January 1<sup>st</sup>. Duffy was a brilliant pianist
and a smoker. She was wonderful company at all times. Sid played a one-string
fiddle and he had a brother, who was often in the party who played banjo. So
there was always lots of singing and lots of laughter. Another frequent visitor
was a young man, older that most of us, who sat on the piano stool and play all
sorts of types of music by ear. Happy days! Well some of them were not entirely
happy. Des became extremely jealous if I laughed around with the others. We
spend a lot of time quarrelling and making it up. At that period in my life I
was travelling up to London daily, we always sent up on the same train, during
which time he tried to teach me theory by setting me questions as homework. He
was very interested, and knowledgeable, in Egyptology, so I had a course in
that. Most favoured my me was his
knowledge of Dickens's London. He had an uncle, his mother's sister's husband
called Pentlow, who was a authority on Dickens and had taken Des around to
various places, to which he later took me. We also went to concerts in London..
The Prides had a bungalow at Selsey Bill and I joined them on two holidays,
then one year Des and I went and stayed a week at a Bed and Breakfast. The
owner made certain that we did not go into each other's rooms at any time under
her roof! We were always hungry and our meagre funds were spent on Lyons cakes
etc., but it was such a happy break for us both. In due course I became disenchanted and so often we disagreed,
resulting in brief separations, then he would compose something and send it to
me and back again together until the next time. He sent me more compositions
and we went together to hear the Royal Choral Society sing Messiah at the
Albert Hall where we had a box! In the end I realised I could not live with him
peacefully, and as I had known a childhood overshadowed with parental rows, I
went my own way.</p>



<p>I arranged to go to Switzerland, booked up a
Mediterranean cruise for the following year, took part in concerts given by our
ballet class, and went to a dance to do with the office in London, and the MC
was Mr George Windsor! After a dance he would stay talking to me and I had to
remind him of his MC duties. It so happened that he had tennis elbow and so had
Saturdays free, during which we walked miles or took a train to the coast. We
had to work Saturday morning then. He saw me off on my cruise on the Moldavia
and that is another story. Des also decided to learn German and at his class,
as I later learnt, he met and was married to another student a year after I became
married. So ends the tale.</p>

<p>Vera Smith and I had to share a cabin with two
other girls, another Vera - so she became Veronica, and Grace Pickard from
Derbyshire. Grace and I sparked off each other, and the other two got on
together. The first evening I danced with Charles - he earlier insisted I must
straight away post a card to my parents as it would be collected before we
sailed - which I did, and also one to George. During the cruise we were mostly
with one group during the day, and another in the evening. Our first stop was
at Tangiers and as I stepped on the quay side I called out &quot;I'm actually
in Africa!&quot; There was light grey uniformed police officer who was amused
by this, and he came to say a few words, ending up by saying &quot;Look for me
when you return&quot;. Eight of us went off on donkeys each with a native
guide. It was hilarious. At any ascent or descent the donkeys would all bray
and make a shocking row. I cant remember much more of that day except that on
our return to the quay my police officer friend was waiting with a lovely
Moorish bowl, a photograph of himself and his address. The bowl I later had
hanging up in the hall at No. 6 Hayes Chase. After some years there, we found
it one day in pieces on the floor. Back on the boat we did Keep Fit exercises
every morning, and games. I was a finalist in the Deck Tennis competition. Our
next port of call was Barcelona, a lovely city, flowers everywhere. We had a
trip up Mount Tibidabo. At the top an ornate large church. Our next stop was at
Algiers, and again we saw the native quarters and shopping areas, but
unforgettable was when driven up high about the town at dusk and out to sea.
Our last stop was at Gibraltar, where we went shopping in the narrow very busy
shopping street and I bought orange and black silk pyjamas which I never wore!
Most of tour time was spent on the beach, swimming and sun bating. W did a lot
of swimming on board, We also took part in a concert - Vera and I sang duets.
An another occasion Grace and I collected for the &quot;unseen&quot; crew and later had drinks with the Purser.
It was a wonderful holiday. We had arrived back in London mid-day, I think,
because, we four girls and the day guys went along to a variety theatre in the
afternoon and most of them went to sleep! Later Vera and I met Charles and
another chap and we were taken to a Night Club, which I found very dull. I have
to remind readers that this was in the 1930's where there was every respect
given to women. I don't remember kissing any of the chaps or anyone trying to
kiss me. Very different from today, so far as I understand today's standards.</p>

<p><i>Ray with friends on her cruise</i></p>


<p>I had put in for a transfer on my very first
day at the Money Order Department and after 1 and a half years there a move
came. I was sent to Accountant General's Department's head office in the City,
on my birthday in 1927. Three weeks later I was joined by Winnie Amas. I also
became friends with Marjorie Bennett who lived at Catford. A group of 8 of us
put 1 shilling aside for a club and took it in turn to choose a theatre where
we would go once a month. Another was the music club, which I ran. We each
brought a piece of music, which was passed round to the members and was
eventually kept by you. There was also a holiday club collection. My first
holiday was with Marjorie Bennet and we went to Shanklin Old village. We
enjoyed our first week but by sister Eva, who was very ill and being looked
after at home, had died and I had to return. She had married a Civil Servant at
Somerset House who was a very good singer and was in the choir at Beddington
Church. I often played for him to sing at home.</p>

<img src="office.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT" ></td>
<p><i>Ray and George with friends from the office</i></p>

<p>Having returned to the daily round once again,
George and I continued to meet at weekends and sometimes during the week. Being
and organist and choirmaster he was busy Tuesday, Fridays and Sundays as well
as weddings and funerals. The Royal Choral Society was another commitment. I
went to a performance of Hiawatha in which George took part. The whole arena
was used and it was a most colourful presentation, both to see and to hear. I
was soon roped in after having an audition. At that time Malcolm Sargent was
ill and we had a series of conductors, including Beecham, Vaughan Williams, and
Dame Ethel Smyth to name a few. Another occasion was a party given to members,
with dancing etc and Malcolm walked around speaking a few spicy words. In
rehearsal I sat in the third row, so could hear all the tit-bits he said -
never at a loss for the right word. It was after a recital of Elijah that
George and I walked through Kensington Gardens and we stood on the bridge,
still affected by the great volume of sound we had been part of, when he asked
me to marry him! We found a secluded, dimly lit tea place and we had soft roes
on toast! Then we went off to what was then, the Old Vic, and saw Cav. and Pag.
- another feast of musical sound. George was already 31, so there was no point
in a long engagement. We fixed the date for July 1st 1933. Sisters Kath and
Phyllis and friend Vera Smith were bridesmaids and a friend who lived near him,
Reg. Bridle was best man. It was a lovely wedding held at St Mary's Church
Shortlands where George was organist, so there was a full choir and a large
congregation. His leading soloist was sang &quot;Where're you walk&quot; by
Handel at the signing of the register. A reception was held at the Church Hall,
Before I left for the Church (I had to change at Cedars Road, and George at
Reg. Bridle's house) I sat at the piano and played and sang &quot;Today I am so
happy!&quot; A very dear friend of ours, Ken Bell played the organ. He later
drove us back to our new house, Trebarwith, 6, Hayes Chase where our car was
already packed so were quit unprepared for the showers of confetti when we
opened them at Alresford, Hants, our first stop. We were up betimes and went to
Holy Communion before breakfast, then on the Newquay, Cornwall where we stayed
at the Trebarwith Hotel right on the front, with private steps down to the sea.
It was a very happy time for us, lots of swimming and walking and party group
outings.

 Back to our own home again - new house, new furnishing, new husband
and wife. Such a lot to learn and experience. At times I felt very lonely with
George away all day and I started looking at job advertisements. But in those
days, 1933, it was not &quot;done&quot;. We both joined the Cedars Tennis Club
(George 's old club at Beckenham) and of course George had two choir practices,
plus choir every Monday evening. Our 2nd year, we holidayed at Capel Curig,
North Wales - a lovely spot. Walks and climbs were organised, George going on
the climbs and I on the walks. There was a tennis court which we used, and a
wide part of the river where we occasionally swam.</p>

<p>Delia was born on May 19th 1935 at Oakham nursing
home. Our doctor thought I should have three weeks there as it would
save trouble at middle-age! I longed to get home. When I did arrive it was to
be greeted with strings of flags from the front wall of the house to the garden
wall. Also, an iced Welcome Home cake George had ordered. So began years of
learning by experience. Before marriage I had taken a short cookery course at a
state evening school near the Elephant and Castle in London and emerged with a
certificate which I framed for the kitchen a as reminder. In due course I
acquired a charlady. I could not have found better person and she was with me 
twice a week for years. </p>

<p>I remember being in our dining room at Hayes
Chase, West Wickham listening to the wireless, and hearing Chamber lain
re-affirm the British pledge to Poland, in July 1939. We were all issued with
gas masks and told to wear them at all time except when sleeping! There was a
rush to buy extra sugar and butter. Most school children were evacuated but we
had had a deep shelter built in our garden at rear, within natural woodland. It
had also been arranged that I should take Delia and Colin down to stay with my
sister Grace and brother in law Graham at Worthing. They would have been forced
to have taken in evacuees in any case. They had no young family of their own
and were not at all happy to have a couple of very young ones to disrupt the
even tenor of their days. Driving down with no sign posts and very
apprehensive, we were there when war was actually declared. However in the
Worthing area nothing much was happening. </p>

<p><i>George all ready for the home guard</i></p>

<p>George had had to return to work, and
we all wanted to go back to our own home, and did not regret it. We spent
nights in the dugout, sometimes shared by Dorothy Senior, and her dog next
door. We would hear aeroplanes and know if they were &quot;ours&quot; or
&quot;theirs&quot;.</p>


<p>Colin was born on 28th June 1938. I had thought
I would never love as I had loved Delia, but of course, I soon found I could.
Over the early years we had great fun together. With George out so much I read
them stories and played nursery rhymes etc. As they became old enough to cycle we
would on occasions like Good Friday when George had the Messiah at the Albert
Hall and left home by 12 noon, we would go out to the White Bear area and
picnic. When the war started in 1939 Colin was only 1 year old, George joined
the Home Guard. We had a shelter build in the garden and when the air raids
were bad, we slept there. Every day I had to take all the bedding indoors as it
would get damp if left. We did have electricity laid on for light and heat.
There were Canadians at a comp nearby and they filled some sand-bags at the
entrance. </p>

<p>We were having very noisy nights when Colin
developed scarlet fever. I did not want him sent away to hospital so a friend
of my father-in-law said she would look after Delia. I hung a damp sheet over
Colin's bedroom door, changed every time I went into him. One night with a
stick of incendiary bombs had fallen, Colin said &quot;You go down into the
dug-out Mummy, I'll be all right!&quot; I had one neighbour who came in daily
and insisted on me going out for a walk. Her name was Mrs Friend who was indeed
a friend. She lived further down Hayes Chase and was a tower of strength. We
both changed every time we entered the room. Delia was about 5 1/2. I cycled to
see her every evening, about 3 miles each way. I used to sing &quot;I'm going
to see you today&quot;, a song by Joyce Grenfell, popular at the time. I wrote
frequently - I still have some of here letters. At least she did not catch the
complaint. </p>

<p>George was by then in the Ministry of Supply,
Deputy Director of medical Supplies, and when Colin was one and a half years
old was transferred to Leeds. He found us a 4-bedroom house to let 27, Gledhow
Wood Avenue, near Roundhay Park. He found for himself lodgings until I and the
children, plus Joan, our very young maid, plus Fluff, our cat, arrived. I had
to see to all the removal, taking up stair carpet, curtains etc. A large bomb
had exploded fairly near, so, some people across the road saw to the repairs
and rented Trebarwith, agreeing to get out when we were able to return.
Thankfully that did all work out well. The day we left we could not find Fluff,
but he arrive in a laundry basket several days later, very sooty, having hidden
up the chimney! We arrived at our new home about 4 pm and dusk. It was January
and several inches of snow. The furniture van was already there and the men digging
a pathway to the door.</p>

<p>Our marvellous neighbours, Mrs Burr took us into her
warm house, where pile of bedding were airing before a big kitchen range. The
men could only take in the beds and a few essentials. It was war-time and no
lights were to be shown outside. Mr and Mrs Burr gave our workmen a bed and
meals for the night. George had to go to work next day so after the men had
unloaded and deposited, Joan Pocock, our little 17 year old maid, and I got
things reasonably straight. It was a 4 bedroom house, with a staircase to an
upper floor with a very large room, The kitchen had a stove fired by coal. My
neighbours all made their own bread and before long I did the same. It was a
large kitchen. In fact all the rooms were. Outside was a separate wash room,
with boiler and there were other out-places. Not a very big garden, but enough
to grow some vegetables. Mrs Burr
turned out to be a really wonderful friend. Her daughter, about 17, and still
at school and Joan palled up quickly. A younger brother was learning to play
the violin, so I was able to help him. The area was called Roundhay and there
was an extensive park with lakes and swings.</p>

<p><i>Our cat Fluff at Holland Way</i></p>

<p>So began a new life. We joined a tennis club
and had a few outings in the car, but with petrol rationed we could not go far.
I was in Leeds shopping one day when I was asked to become a blood donor, which
I did as asked, there and then. Hence I was late back with the diner, live and
bacon still in my bag. Before long the powers that be were sending George back
to London for short stays at first, then longer spells. Eventually he had to
return for good so we all did, and were fortunate to get the people renting
Trebarwith to move just across Pickhurst lane. There had been a bomb dropped
fairly near so we had to have that repaired with was essential -not a lot 
thanks be. By then the war in the
air was on. There was much more activity as regards air-raids and George used
to do night duty in Bromley after a day's work and all the difficulties of
travelling. House keeping was a worry. If one heard that oranges or bananas
were in a certain shop, I'd rush off on my bike and queue. Most essentials were
rationed as well as clothing which was on coupons.</p>

<p>During the war I ran the road's collection of
things and to help the war effort. My &quot;gang&quot; called &quot;Gogs&quot;
(cogs in a wheel) worked hard and I still have the register I made. During the
war Dartrey House Kindergarten where Delia stared her schooling was evacuated
to Wales and only a few pupils were left, Dr Pitt-Paynes, Bruce, Malcolm
Marshall, Delia and perhaps another 5 or 6 children. We all became very
friendly. Gwen Marshall and I particularly and the Pitt-Paynes, as they
belonged to the Park Langley Tennis Club. The Marshalls had an allotment
adjacent to ours, across Pickhurst Road, where we grew our vegetables.</p>

<p><i>A Christmas card from the Seniors next door</i></p>

<p>During the war days, I took a course of violin
lessons from Mrs Hay in Pickhurst lane.
My eldest sister Grace, gave me her violin before we went out to Malaya and I
enjoyed my lessons, even if the siren stopped us occasionally. At the end of
term, we gave a concert, mostly children, but several adults.</p>

<p>At last the war ended and Hayes Chase had a
glorious celebration. A big party in the road for all the children and later a
magnificent firework display organised by my friend still today, Mac Evans, how
'phones me regularly and we talk about the days when we both live in Hayes
Chase. The war years were behind us, but rationing and clothing coupons
continued for some long time. It was wonderful to be able to sleep peacefully
in one's own bed again.</p>


<img src="dramatics.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT"></td>
<p><i>A Park Langley Dramatics programme October 1948</i></p>

<p>In due course an association called &quot;The
Park Langley Residents&quot; was formed- a sort of social club where members
could meet, play table tennis and other games, and a group gave a concert with
included a one act play. My adenoidal &quot;Sorry to disturb you, Miss
Tremaine&quot; - the opening words - have been echoed over the years. It was a
great success, and although in time, the Club as such folded up our group
formed a proper company called &quot;The Park Langley Players&quot;. My good
friend was our brilliant stage manager, and his, and my dear friend, Walter
Dossett was produce, again quite brilliant. By a strange coincidence Walter was
an old friend of the Prides and very musical. The company still continued after
we left Hayes, and still is, I understand, under a different name. They were
happy days.<P>

<p>Another side-line was accompanying a friend Mrs
Barclay, a local contralto singer, for her convert practise work, and also for
lessons she gave to another woman. For this I was paid. It was while I was with
them that we heard of the death of Kathleen Ferrier, and we were all too sad to
continue.</p>

<p>Here I must remember the Windsor Ensemble,
George on piano, Colin on clarinet, Gordon Bartlet on trombone and Delia on the
recorder. Colin worked out solo pieces for Delia as her instrument drowned her
contribution. It was great fun - Gordon would choose Delia's solos to clean out
his trombone for which I provided a saucer!</p>

<img src="convent.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT"></td>
<p><i>Holy Trinity Convent, Bromley in 2000</i></p>

<p>I think Delia was about 7 or 8 when we started
to look for a school for her. Our choice would have been Mary Dachelor because
of its musical tradition, but at another school, Haberdasher Askes, the head
mistress advised some place nearer her home as a daily long journey could
become too tiring, especially later on. Good advice, we thought, and eventually
chose Holy Trinity Convent. We were impressed by the Rev. Mother and the
building and grounds, so she stared there, Colin also for 2 years or so. The
Sisters always asked after him and I often wonder what Rev. Mother would have
said if she had nown of his progress.
Delia ended up as joint head girl with a catholic. When Colin left he went to
Dulwich College Prep. School where he did extremely well. One afternoon a woman
stopped me and said, &quot;your son I always so well behave on the train.&quot;
It was at the prep he first met Roger Tolman, and I met his mother Mary, always
my very dear friend.</p>

<p>Colin did not get into the College, but as it
transpired it was a good thing. It was not so far to travel to Beckenham as
Sydenham and there was a musical tradition and also an excellent science
master. Colin was encouraged to sit for a Demiship at Magdalen College, Oxford,
the only one going for which he was eligible and he was awarded it! The news
came by post. I guessed what it was and could scarcely wait for their return.
When I heard the car, I rushed to the front door and in came Colin, with
George's trilby askew on his head and looking as though they had already been
celebrating. We were all delighted. During the next few years we began to know
more and more about Oxford and the surrounding country.</p>


<p>Delia left Holy Trinity and went to learn
shorthand and typing. She was not very happy about this but we felt she had to
be trained for a career of some sort. As things turned out she met Mike and
later they were wed. Later still they had three stalwart sons - our first
grandsons.<p>

<p><i>At Parklangley Tennis Club</i></p>


<p>George retired in 1961 but we remained at
Holland Way until 1970, chiefly because we played a lot of tennis at first. My
usual ladies four - actually we were seven but we had a rota so there was
usually a stand -in if one of us could not manage the day. Eventually we had
two mixed fours. Meanwhile we studied the local newspapers for a bungalow, and
went to look a places in quite a large area. We decided on a new one at Hawkhurst
, Kent paid a deposit, come home and I certainly had a bad night thinking we
had made a mistake. Next morning we drove to agent and fortunately, he still
had the cheque which he returned straight away. Relief all round! We had told
Delia and Colin about it and the next we heard Delia and family had driven to
Worthing and on to a place called Ferring, and had found a suitable place near
shops and bus route and gave us the name of the House Agent. We wrote and asked
for particulars and were sent several. George had said I would never be
satisfied! Not so, but I did know what I definitely did not want! We decided to
look at three. The first in a tiny close of three bungalows, dark, unused for a
long time it seemed. The second had an excellent added kitchen, but the rest
was very old fashioned, and the two bedrooms were very small, The third one
&quot;Charnwood&quot; for me fitted what we needed. It was February and the
owner's married daughter was stretched out on a garden &quot;bed&quot;, the sun
pouring into the excellent sun lounge, in the living room a wall for the piano and music cabinet. At first I
was not keen on the kitchen facing the road, but now I am so thankful. Being on
my own it is good to see other people round and about. Thus wheels were put in
motion. We sold Holland Way and came to Ferring in May 1970.</p>

<p>We were at Ferring 3 weeks when Jonathan was
born and we went up to Avebury. As a toddler he cam down occasionally to stay
with us but really his heart was back at Avebury. I shall never forget the
first time we say the twins. It was through class in the intensive care room,
one in the arms of a white nurse the other with a dark nurse, so tiny, so frail
looking. Thinking of them now it is difficult to imagine that time had brought
about such a difference. Elizabeth always brimful of energy, following Jon in
every possible way. Darling Jane had so much to contend with - her eyxma a
continual trial which I have always thought she bore with amazing patience.</p>
