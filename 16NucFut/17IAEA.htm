<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>Since the mid -1980s the spherical tokamak (ST) has been
recognized as an important device for fusion research [1-4].
Such devices demonstrate all the main features of high aspect
ratio tokamaks but are relatively small and inexpensive to construct.
Moreover, research has shown that they have beneficial
properties such as operation at high beta [2], can be run at
higher elongation [3, 4], and possibly exhibit higher confinement
[4], although more data are needed at higher field and
lower collisionality to determine this important aspect. Early                  
attempts to design reactors based on STs did not produce convincing
designs, and until recently STs have been mainly seen
as useful research devices and possibly as neutron sources for
component testing. However, recent advances in both tokamak
physics and superconductor technology have changed the
situation, and relatively small STs operating at high fusion
gain are now considered possible. The key physics step is the
realization that the power and the device size needed for high
fusion gain may be considerably less than previous estimates,
while the key technological step is the advent of ReBCO high
temperature superconductors (HTS). In addition to operating
at relatively high temperatures, HTS can also produce 
and withstand relatively high magnetic fields: both of these
properties are beneficial in the design of magnets for fusion
devices especially for STs where space is limited in the central
column. Sorbom <I>et al</I> [5] have considered the application of
HTS to tokamaks of conventional aspect ratio and produced a
design for ARC, a fusion power plant slightly greater in size
than JET and at considerably higher field. In this paper, we
describe the tokamak energy (TE) programme to develop an
alternative route to fusion power based on STs constructed
using HTS magnets, and the modelling and concept work
underway to determine the optimum power and size of an
ST/HTS fusion module. This work identifies key aspects in
the physics and technology that significantly affect the size,
power and feasibility of such a module. In parallel, experimental
work is underway addressing these aspects, including
the construction and operation of a series of STs. In this paper,
we present recent new results and the status of the development
programme, and we outline the intended next steps.

<P>The paper is divided into five main sections. In section 2
we summarise briefly our earlier modelling work that indicates
that there is potentially a solution for a high fusion
performance device at relatively small major radius and low
aspect ratio. In section 3, we give an overview of the TE development
programme; we include a brief description of the STs
operated, presently under construction and planned at TE.
Our predictions of the performance of a candidate ST fusion
module are extended and updated in section 4. Possibilities for
modular fusion are discussed briefly in section 5. A summary
is given in section 6.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>Recent modelling with a system code based on an established
physics model has shown that, when operated at reasonable
fractions of the density and beta limits, tokamak pilot plants
and reactors have a power gain, <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I> , that is only weakly dependent
on size; mainly it depends on <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I> , and H, where <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  is
the fusion power and <I>H</I> is the confinement enhancement factor
relative to empirical scalings [6]. Frequently the ITER reference
scaling (IPB98y2) is used and <I>H</I> is defined relative to
that. When expressed in dimensionless variables this scaling
has a significant inverse dependence on the plasma beta,
(&beta;<SUP>-0.9</SUP>). However, dedicated experiments on several devices in
which the dependence of the confinement time on beta has
been probed directly, have shown that the confinement time
is almost independent of beta; alternative beta-independent
scalings have been developed, for example that by Petty [7].
These scalings are arguably more appropriate because they
give consistency between single device and multi-device
experiments. Modelling with the system code has shown that
the power needed for a given fusion gain is a factor of two to
four lower with these scalings (figure 1) [6].

<P>The dependence on <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  implies that it is principally engineering
and technological aspects, such as wall and divertor
loads, rather than physics considerations, that determine the
minimum device size. The lower power requirement arising
from the beta-independent scalings is especially advantageous.
Using the system code, a wide parameter scan was
undertaken to establish possible regions of parameter space
that could potentially offer high <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  with acceptable engineering
parameters. In addition to the high aspect ratio, large
tokamak solution, a region of parameter space at low aspect
ratio and relatively small major radius, and hence small
plasma volume, has been identified (figure 1). The physics
advantages (such as high beta) of low aspect ratio potentially
enable a compact ST module to achieve a high fusion gain at
a modest toroidal field (TF) of around 4 T, whereas a compact
conventional aspect ratio tokamak requires a very high field
on axis ~12 T to achieve high fusion gain as evidenced by
Ignitor [15]. A candidate device (ST135) with a major radius
(<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>) of 1.35 m, aspect ratio (<I>A</I>) of 1.8 and magnetic field on
axis (<I>B<SUB>T0</SUB></I>) of 3.7 T operating at <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  = 185 MW with a <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I> 
of 5 was suggested. The study that led to this proposal was
mainly a physics study; engineering aspects were not investigated.
Some important engineering and technological aspects
are currently being developed and key results are presented in
this paper (section 4).

<P><I>3.1. HTS</I>
<P>Use of conventional low temperature superconductor (LTS)
for an ST fusion device appears impractical because thick
shielding (>~1 m) would be needed to prevent neutrons heating
the superconductor to above 4 K. With shielding of this thickness
on the inner central column, the device would be very
large. The advent of HTS, however, potentially provides
a solution. HTSs were discovered in the late 1980s and the
2nd generation ReBCO (where Re = Yttrium or Gadolinium)
tapes have very promising properties; in particular, they are
able to carry high currents under very high magnetic fields.
Although superconductivity occurs at around 91 K in zero
magnetic field, far better performance is achieved when cooled
to around 20-40 K. Thus, for constructing tokamaks, HTS has
potentially two advantages relative to LTS: an ability to carry
more current at high field, and less demanding cryogenics [8].

given in [6]. The conventional large tokamak solution (left) and the potential low <I>A</I> solutions (right) are indicated. The circled areas show
that, with the beta-independent scaling, the wall loads and divertor loads for a relatively small (<I>R</I> = 1.4 m) low aspect ratio (1.8) device
would be in the range of 3.5 MW m<SUP>-2</SUP> and 45 MW m<SUP>-1</SUP> respectively, for the same <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I> . 
This is challenging (although proposals to reduce
the divertor load in an ST are described in section 4.2) but in the region of those likely to have to be dealt with in much larger and more
powerful devices. The value of <I>B<SUB>cond</SUB></I> is high in the case of the low <I>A</I> approach but potentially achievable using magnets made with HTS
(sections 3 and 4).</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>

<P>To gain experience with constructing tokamaks using magnets
made from HTS, TE constructed a small but complete
tokamak (figure 2). This provided the world's first demonstration
of a tokamak magnet where all the magnets are made
from HTS. All coils (toroidal and poloidal) are wound from
YBCO HTS tape. The 6-limb TF cryostat is cooled 'cryo-free'
to ~20 K using a single Sumitomo cold head seen above the
vessel, thermal conduction from the HTS tape being provided
by copper strips; the two poloidal field (PF) coils being cooled
by He gas to 20-50 K. A 29 h run was obtained in June 2015,
with an RF discharge in hydrogen (figure 2). The TF magnet
in ST25(HTS) used a continuous length of 12 mm wide YBCO
tape of 48 turns in each of 6 limbs which when operated at 400
A would provide a TF at <I>R</I> = 0.25 m of ~0.1 T, chosen to
permit current drive (CD) via 2.45 GHz microwave sources.
This simple design is prone to single point failure (particularly
at any of the several soldered joints), was not designed to
tolerate quenches, and was operated considerably below the
critical current which is ~1 kA at 20 K and in the low self-field
which is <1 T at the inner TF limb. A high performance fusion
ST will need a TF of 3-4 T, which requires the development
of high current HTS cables. TE is currently developing HTS
cable, joint and quench management technologies required to
build and operate a larger device that will operate at higher
field and with very large stored energy (section 3.4). A major
challenge is the design of the central column, and this is being
addressed in the design work for ST135 (section 4.1).
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><I>3.3. ST40</font></I>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       


<P>To date STs have operated at TFs of less than 1 T. For high
fusion performance, devices operating at 3 T or above will
be needed. To construct an ST that can operate at fields at
this level, innovative engineering solutions will be needed
especially for the central column. To develop and demonstrate
solutions to the key engineering aspects, TE is constructing a
device (ST40) with copper magnets that is intended to operate
at fields up to 3 T. Beyond this device TE is planning high field
STs using HTS. ST40 (figure 3), will have a design field of
<I>B<SUB>T0</SUB></I> = 3 T at major radius of <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 0.4 m, and a centre-rod current
of 6 MA. Use of copper for the TF coil (as in all existing
STs, except ST25HTS at TE) has the advantages of combining
structural strength with good conductivity (especially when
cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature). Whereas existing STs
have operated typically at 0.3-0.5 T, with the recent MAST,
Globus-M and NSTX upgrades striving for 1 T, innovative
design features are employed to enable ST40 to operate at up
to 3 T. Principal amongst these is the use of Constant Tension
Curve TF limbs, specially designed so that over the permitted
temperature rise (whether starting from ambient or from
liquid nitrogen temperature) the expansions of the centre post
and the return limbs are matched, so that minimal movement
occurs at the critical top and bottom joints, a simple robust
flexi-joint being provided to accommodate the movement.
At fields of 3 T, stresses are high; and an external support
structure based on two steel rings (shown in grey above
and below the magnet) accommodates in-plane and out of
plane forces, such as those arising from tolerance errors in
the radial position, and the JxB twists arising from TF-PF
and TF-solenoid interactions. The ST40 mechanical design
was analysed extensively by a series of electromagnetic analyses
using Opera [10], which simulated the forces expected
in operational scenarios, including Vertical Displacement
Events. These forces were then used in mechanical Finite
Element Analyses of major components, using Ansys [11]. For
example the central column of the TF magnet, formed from 24
twisted wedge-shaped conductors, exhibits highest stress at
the inner edge. For the maximum wedge current of 0.25 MA
required to produce a field of 3 T at plasma major radius of
0.4 m, this stress is ~100 MPa in the copper. The copper is half
hard, with a yield stress around 180 MPa. Comparing this to
the Von Mises yield criterion gives a factor of safety on yield
of 1.8.

<P>An important aid to obtaining such a high field is the use in
ST40 of a minimal solenoid, made possible by the merging-compression
(MC) process for plasma start-up. This should
produce hot plasmas with currents of up to 2 MA without
use of the central solenoid, which is only needed to maintain
the flat-top current-assisted by the high bootstrap fractions
expected, and CD from NBI or RF. Hence, the solenoid
is considerably smaller than in MAST and NSTX and their
upgrades. This reduces JxB twisting stresses, allows more
copper for the TF column which reduces TF resistance and
heating, and provides a stronger TF post.

Sumitomo cold head shown above the magnet.</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>

<P>The centre post is constructed from 24 wedges, each
twisted by 15 degrees over their length thus obviating the
need for a TF compensating coil. The TF, solenoid and PF
coils are powered by 'Supercapacitors' such as the Maxwell
125 V, 63 F, 0.5 MJ transport module, providing a very economic
power supply from laboratory power supplies. Each
unit has a limiting fault current ~7 kA even under dead short
conditions providing safety; an important consideration in a
100 MJ capacitor bank. The plasma pulse length is limited
by the temperature
rise in the centre post; initial operations
with a water-cooled TF magnet will provide a TF of 1-2 T
at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 0.4 m with a flat top of 1-3 s; operation with liquid
nitrogen cooling considerably reduces resistance and hence
heating and enables longer pulses, and should permit operation
at up to 3 T with a flat top of ~1 s.
<P>The MC coils (indicated in figure 3) operated successfully
in START and MAST, and extrapolation to ST40 is discussed
in [12]. The MC process involves the formation of plasma
rings around each of the MC coils shown in figure 3 by rapid
discharge of high voltage capacitor banks. These plasma rings
attract each other and merge on the midplane, followed by
an adiabatic compression of the plasma to the desired major
radius of ~0.4 m. It is shown that plasma current immediately
after merging increases with TF and linearly with MC coil
current. In ST40 the TF and MC coil current are increased
over those in MAST by factors of up to 6 and 2 respectively.
Extrapolation indicates ST40 should have plasma current after
merging of around 1 MA; the subsequent adiabatic compression
phase halves the radius in ST40 and should approximately
double the plasma current, assisted by the significant
reduction in inductance of the plasma ring as it takes up the
highly shaped ST form. The MC scheme will be operated at
the highest performance permissible, to produce the highest
possible plasma currents and plasma temperatures. The final
design features MC coil currents of 600 kAt in each coil, produced
by a 11 kV, 28 mF capacitor bank, with a downswing
time of ~10 ms which induces the plasma rings, and uses very
slender support legs (to minimise interference with the plasma
rings which have changing helicity). The MC coil mounting
structure was analysed in Ansys, and a prototype was tested
to 10 000 cycles at the design load of 73 kN, and then finally
pulled to destruction. Final failure occurred at approximately
3 times the design load.

<P>In addition to the original objective of providing a high
vacuum version of the pioneering START ST at a tenfold
increase in TF, the specification has been extended: indeed,
it is expected that the MC scheme will provide up to 10 keV
plasmas in ST40, the plasma being heated by the rapid conversion
of magnetic field energy into plasma kinetic energy
during the merging. Full details of its predicted performance,
and of the expected evolution of electron and ion temperature
profiles are provided in [12], based on extensive studies on
both MAST and Japanese STs in collaboration with Y Ono
and his team [13]. The ST40 device is currently under construction
and is expected to begin operation in 2017.

<P>As mentioned above, the intention is to combine the experience
gained with the low field HTS device ST25(HTS) with
that obtained with the high field copper device ST40 to design
and construct high field STs using HTS for the magnets. The
objectives will be to develop physics understanding of a high
field ST, to test HTS cable technology, and to establish HTS
performance during DT fusion conditions. ST40 should provide
valuable information to determine energy confinement
scaling in a high-field ST. TE is designing a high field HTS
magnet, using cable technology similar to that described in
section 4, to establish the engineering viability. Research is
advancing rapidly on these topics, both in-house and worldwide,
and the precise DT fusion experiments are still under
consideration. As shown in section 4.3 these can range in
size from small short pulse research devices, to steady state
devices of major radius ~2 m.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>4. Conceptual design of a prototype fusion power module: ST135</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>While from a physics perspective it seems that a compact
fusion module may be possible (section 2), the feasibility of
such a device depends critically on there being satisfactory
engineering solutions in a few critical areas. Three important
components are the central column where it is necessary to
handle the stress in this component at the same time as accommodating
the HTS TF magnet; the divertor where it is necessary
to handle high power loads; the inboard shielding which
is needed to protect the HTS tape from bombardment from
high energy neutrons so that it has an acceptable lifetime, and
also to reduce the neutron heating to a level that can be handled
with a reasonable cryogenic system. Possible solutions
for these components are under study and development within
TE, and are outlined in the following sections.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><I>4.1. HTS central column design</font></I>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>One possible arrangement (figure 4) utilises two significant
features of HTS tape: namely, operation at 20-30 K that gives
sufficient current carrying capability at high magnetic field,
but at much lower cryogenic cooling cost than operation at
4 K, and the property that tape aligned parallel to the local
magnetic field can carry several times more current than nonaligned
tape. In this simple model the individual HTS tapes
are bonded into multi-layer cables, and for the initial calculations
we assume that the entire structure has the strength of
half-hard copper.

<P>Towards the geometric centre of the column, the magnetic
field reduces and in consequence the current carrying capacity
of the HTS tape increases. This makes it possible to reduce the
number of tapes. For this simplified design, in which the HTS
cables are arranged to produce a uniform current density over
the central HTS magnet, we can derive a simple expression for
the peak stress which is at <I>r</I> = 0, as follows.
<P>Current density in the centre rod magnet is <I>J<SUB>cc</SUB> = 
I<SUB>cc</SUB>/(&pi;
</span>R<SUB>cc</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>) </I>

where <I>I<SUB>cc</SUB></I>(MA) is the total centre rod current, and 
<I>R<SUB>cc</SUB></I>(m) is the
radius of the magnet. Since we are assuming constant current
density in the central column, the TF in Tesla at any radius
<I>r(m)</I> within it is <I>B(r) = 0.2 r I<SUB>cc</SUB>/R<SUB>cc</SUB><SUP>2</SUP></I>. 
If we neglect hoop stress and integrate the J x B force from <I>r</I>
to <I>R<SUB>cc</SUB></I> we can obtain the 
inward force at any radius within the central column. We find
that the peak compressive stress
 (<I>&sigma;<SUB>cc</SUB></I>) occurs at the column
axis, and is

<DIR><P><I>&sigma;<SUB>cc</SUB>= 0.25&pi;B<SUB>T<SUB>0</SUB></SUB><SUP>2</SUP>
(R<SUB>0</SUB> R<SUB>cc</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>2</SUP></I>  MPa   (1)
</DIR>
<P>where we have used Ampere's law <I>B<SUB>T<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 
0.2 I<SUB>cc</SUB>/<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> to replace
<I>I<SUB>cc</SUB></I>, where <I>B<SUB>T<SUB>0</SUB></SUB></I>
 is the TF in Tesla at the plasma major radius
<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>(m).

<P>For the reference ST135 design, <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 1.35 m, <I>R<SUB>cc</SUB></I> = 0.25 m,
plasma current = 7.2 MA, <I>B<SUB>T<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 3.7 T, <I>A</I> 
= 1.8, elongation
&kappa; = 2.64, and so the peak field at the edge of the HTS magnet
is 20 T and the central column current is 25 MA. With a neutron
shield thickness of 0.35 m, the calculated peak radial
stress is 320 MPa. This is high but is in the form of uniform
hydrostatic compression when an axial compressive stress of
the same order is provided (below).

<P>A finite element analysis of the centre column with a
Young's modulus of 90 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.35 gives
a peak stress of 255 MPa. This lower figure reflects the support
provided by tangential stiffness. However a practical centre
column containing cooling channels and various materials
with different mechanical properties is likely to have higher
localised stress. We find expression (1), although approximate,
useful for scoping studies.

<P>Expression (1) shows that forces increase as the square of
the TF, but reduce as the square of the central column radius.
Hence for example, a 0.05 m addition (20%) to the HTS core
radius (accompanied by a 0.05 m decrease in shield thickness,
if it is desired to maintain the aspect ratio of 1.8), reduces the
field at <I>R<SUB>cc</SUB></I> to 16.7 T and the peak stress to 205 MPa whilst
maintaining a field of 3.7 T at <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 1.35 m.

<P>Other stresses are also important: in particular, stresses
arising from axial loads at the inboard TF leg are considerable
and can be the limiting stresses [14] depending on the device
design. These stresses are not yet included in our analysis.
The compact radial build of an ST module, however, should
make it feasible to include an external mechanical structure to
apply a pre-load compression of the centre-rod. If this can be
accomplished successfully, then the compressive stress would
dominate. As a point of comparison, we note that Ignitor has
developed a design solution along these lines [15]. In that
case, the necessary mechanical strength has been obtained
by designing the copper coils and its steel structural elements
(C-clamps, central post, bracing rings) in such a way that the
entire system, with the aid of an electromagnetic press when
necessary, can provide the appropriate degree of rigidity to the
central legs of the coils to handle the electrodynamic stresses,
while allowing enough deformation to cope with the rapid
thermal expansion of the short pulse machine. The compact
aspect of an ST should make a similar approach possible.
Whereas it is conventional to twist superconductor cables
to minimize AC losses these will not be significant in the TF
magnet of an ST power plant as this will have a slow rise to
reach a constant peak current. With a suitable design, use can

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       


<P>High power plasmas in relatively small devices would impose
high divertor loads if operated in the single-null (SN) configuration,
especially in an ST where the inner strike point is
at low radius, and space to mitigate the power load by angled
strike points or long divertor legs is limited. However the use
of double-null divertor (DND) operation, as studied extensively
on the START and MAST STs [16], can considerably
improve the loading, as the DND configuration is very favourable
for the ST concept. Firstly, the inner SOL is now (largely)
isolated from the outer, and it is found that most scrape-offlayer
(SOL) power escapes through the outer segment and so
is incident on the outer strike points; the inner/outer power
ratio varies widely, dependent on plasma conditions. During
ELMs the ratio can be over 20 times higher; during inter-ELM
periods when the core heating is partially retained, the ratio
can fall to 4, approximately the ratio of the inner and outer
SOL areas; but the average ratio is typically taken as 10 in
MAST [17].

<P>Full analysis of the divertor performance requires exact
specification of the machine parameters and the detailed
divertor design. These details are not available at the present,
pre-conceptual phase of the ST135 project. Instead, it is
instructive to compare our divertor with the FNSF design [3]
that is similar to ST135. FNSF is particularly relevant because
an HTS version of the (copper magnet) FNSF series was developed
as a joint study between TE and PPPL, and is presently
used as a concept design for ST135, as reported in [18]. The
study of divertor loads in an <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 1.7 m version of FNSF [3]
estimates the peak divertor loads for both the inner and outer
DND strikepoints to be less than 10 MW m<SUP>-2</SUP>. The load on the
divertor target is roughly <I>P<SUB>div</SUB>/S<SUB>w</SUB></I>,
 where <I>P<SUB>div</SUB></I> = <I>P<SUB>SOL</SUB></I> - <I>P<SUB>rad</SUB></I> is
the power delivered to the targets and <I>S<SUB>w</SUB> 
&alpha; R<SUB>trg</SUB> x  f<SUB>x</SUB>
 x &lambda;<SUB>q</SUB></I> is
the effective wetted area. Here <I>P<SUB>SOL</SUB></I> is the power entering the
scrape-off layer (SOL); <I>P<SUB>rad</SUB></I> the power spread over the side
walls, mostly by radiation;  <I>R<SUB>trg</SUB></I> is the radius of the strike point;
<I>f<SUB>x</SUB></I> the flux expansion from the midplane to the target and 
<I>&lambda;<SUB>q</SUB></I>
represents the width of the SOL at the midplane as given by
Eich scaling [19]. In reality, <I>S<SUB>q</SUB></I> includes also flux broadening
and non-proportional power dissipation in the divertor, but for
first estimates one can consider them proportional to 
<I>&lambda;<SUB>q</SUB></I>.

<P>ST135 is designed to have <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  = 200 MW and 
<I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  = 5,
whereas the FNSF design envisages <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  = 160 MW and
<I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  = 2. The heat entering the plasma is the combination
of alpha heating and auxiliary heatink
112 MW in FNSF and 80 MW in ST135, and after radiation
losses due to impurity, Bremsstrahlung and cyclotron radiation
this will enter the SOL. The strike points <I>R<SUB>trg</SUB></I> are at about
20% larger radius in FNSF and expansion <I>f<SUB>x</SUB></I> should be very
similar. The Eich scaling predicts &lambda;<SUB>q</SUB></I> varying as B-1.2
pol and Bpol
is a factor 1.4 higher in FNSF, so 
<I>&lambda;<SUB>q</SUB></I> is a factor 1.5 larger in
ST135. Overall, we conclude that the strike areas should be
similar; and since <I>P<SUB>SOL</SUB></I> is approximately 30% less, the peak
power on each outer divertor in ST135 should be ~7 MW m<SUP>-2</SUP>
compared to ~10 MW m<SUP>-2</SUP> in FNSF. This estimate suggests
that the power loading of the divertor targets in ST135 should
be tolerable. However the effectiveness of DND operation in
limiting inner strike point loads, especially if fast transients
such as ELMs are present, is important and requires further
experimental results on position control, ELM mitigation,
timescales of load transients, etc. Experiments on ST40 are
planned to deal with some of these aspects. Other key engineering
aspects, such as the parallel heat flux and manufacturing
and installation accuracies of the divertor tiles also need
investigation.
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><I>4.3. Shielding, energy deposition, 
neutron flux and damage
in the central core</I></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>An extensive investigation of candidate materials for the inner
shield has been carried out and tungsten carbide with water
cooling has been identified as a promising material [20].
MCNP Monte Carlo Code [21] calculations of the attenuation
due to this shield have been carried out. The attenuation of the
neutron flux, and associated heat deposition in the central core,
as a function of shield thickness have been parameterised
and included in the TE System Code [20]. The heat deposited will
have to be removed actively with a cryoplant and an estimate
of the power requirement is also included. To determine the
optimum shield thickness several factors have to be taken into
account simultaneously. For a device of given <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I> , <I>H</I> factor
and aspect ratio <I>A</I>, it is necessary to consider each of the attenuation
due to the shield, the magnetic field on the HTS tape and
the radial stress in the central column. The TE system code has
been extended so that these different aspects can be considered
simultaneously. It was found that in order to keep the peak radial
stress around its limiting value of 320 MPa as the major radius
increased, the radius of the superconducting core also needed to
increase but less rapidly than the shield thickness increase. The
extra space in the radial build as the major radius increases is
used to increase both the thickness of the shield and of the HTS
core in the ratio: 92% to shield thickness <I>T<SUB>shield</SUB></I> , 8% to the HTS
core radius <I>R<SUB>cc</SUB></I> which approximately maintains constant stress.
As an example, for a reference plasma (<I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  = 5, <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I>  = 201
MW, H(IPB98y2) = 1.9, A = 1.8, &kappa; = 2.64,
 &beta;<SUB>N</SUB> = 4.5), we present in figure 5 the variation of key parameters with major
radius.
<P>We see that at the reference major radius for ST135
(<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 1.35 m), the shield thickness is 0.31 m, the field on the
conductor is 20.2 T, the plasma current is 7.2 MA, the neutron
heating to the central column is 97.7 kW, and the wall load
is 1.88 MW m<SUP>-2</SUP>. To handle this level of neutron heating we
estimate that a cryogenic plant of 3.0 MW wall-plug power
would be needed. It is clear from the figure that as the shield
thickness increases the heating of the central column reduces
rapidly.

<P>Using expression (1), the peak stress in the central column
is 326 MPa. From the comparison with FNSF (section 4.2)
the peak divertor load would be ~7 MW m-2. For all values
of <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>, q*(Menard) defined as 
5 x (1 + &kappa;
<SUP>2</SUP>)/2a<SUP>2</SUP>B/(RI) is >~ 2.8,
the value recommended for avoidance of disruptions in
NSTX [3].

<P>The crosses in figure 5 show computations of the energy
deposition into the superconducting core made using the
MCNP code. It is seen that the fit to the System Code prediction
is good over a wide range of radius without the need for
any change in parameters. The left of the figure corresponds
to the limit of zero shield thickness and it is seen that only
here, for shield thickness below a few cm, that the computed
deposited power falls significantly below the simple exponential
dependence of form 10<SUP>3</SUP> x exp[-6.61(<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> - 1.35)] kW
(where <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> is in m). A key aspect not yet included is any change
in tape performance due to irradiation by neutrons. The neutron
flux across the outer surface of the superconducting core
has been calculated using MCNP. The full triangles in figure 6
show the neutron flux above 0.1 MeV for the outer surface of
the superconducting core as measured in the central mid-plane
region (8.6% of the total core height) where the flux is highest.
The flux variation with major radius fitted at larger radii above
1 m is shown by the dashed lines to decay exponentially
appreciably faster than that for the power deposition mentioned
earlier with a form 3.54 x 10<SUP>17</SUP> exp[-7.08(<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> - 1.35)]
n s<SUP>-1</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP>. It is seen that for lower major radii below 1 m the
flux is rather lower than predicted from the exponential decay.
Indeed for zero shield thickness, which occurs at major radius
0.592 m, the flux is only a fraction 0.283 of its expected value.
This is modeled as shown in the full lines by subtracting from
the above function 5.45 x 10<SUP>19</SUP> exp[-14.56(<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> - 0.592)].

shield thickness <I>T<SUB>shield</SUB></I>  and 8% to the HTS core radius <I>R<SUB>cc</SUB></I> across the plot. The circles show the reference design at 1.35 m major radius. The

<P><IMG SRC="SykesFigure6.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B> Figure 6.</B> The neutron flux across the outer surface of the mid-plane region of the superconducting core for neutron energies above 0.1

m<SUP>-1</SUP>. The blue line is a fit to the flux distribution and the black line the corresponding running time.

</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>


<P>Inevitably the HTS performance will degrade but information
on the extent of the degradation is limited. Eisterer's work
on HTS tapes [22] irradiated in a fission reactor has suggested
that the tape lifetime corresponds to a total neutron fluence of
about 10<SUP>23</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP>. The open diamonds in figure 6 show the seconds
of continuous running assuming this fluence limit. For
many scientific objectives, the actual running time is likely
to be composed of many relatively short pulses. However, the
measurements by Eisterer were made at ambient temperatures
rather than ~30 K as expected during operation. They were
made using a reactor flux whose energy dependence may be
quite different from that expected behind the neutron shield of
a fusion plant. Gamma radiation damage has not been included
and may be important. Raising the temperature of the tape
temporarily (annealing) may restore tape performance. In this
case also information is limited and dedicated R&D is needed.
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>5. A modular power plant</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       


<P>If a relatively small fusion module is feasible, then a possible
alternative supply of fusion power based on a modular
concept may be available. Compared to ST135, a higher <I>Q<SUB>fus</SUB></I> 
would be needed, ~10-20, and the tritium breeding ratio
would need to be >1. To meet these requirements, the device
would probably have to be somewhat larger than ST135 but
still small relative to the large DEMOs considered for the
single device approach. The energy confinement in STs at
high field, and the thickness of shielding needed to protect the
HTS, especially on the central column, have a strong impact
on the minimum size. It is expected that within the next few
years better estimates in both cases will be available through
dedicated R&D and it will be possible to optimise the size
and power of a ST fusion module. The economics and operational
advantages of a modular concept, utilizing perhaps 11
small 100 MW units, (10 working and 1 undergoing maintenance)
have already been outlined [23]. The advantages
include improved availability; cyclic maintenance; the need
for only a relatively small hot cell; a sharing of start-up and
energy conversion facilities; the possibility of providing
plant output varying in time by switching individual modules,
and the economics of mass-production. STs can exhibit
the combination of high bootstrap fraction and high beta - 
important both for maximizing power gain and in obtaining/
maintaining the plasma current, especially in the absence of a
central solenoid. In this latter respect, recent predictions that
RF techniques can provide full plasma current initiation and
ramp-up [24] are encouraging; initial tokamak-like plasma
can be formed by using electron Bernstein wave (EBW) startup
alone [25]. Then EBW CD may be used further for the
plasma current ramp-up because of its relatively high efficiency
<I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>h</span> = 
R<SUB>0</SUB></I>n<SUB>c</SUB>I<SUB>CD</SUB>/P<SUB>RF</SUB> ~ 
0.035 (10<SUP>20</SUP> A W<SUP>-1</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP></I>) [26] at
low electron temperatures. EBW CD efficiency remains high
even in over-dense (<I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>w</span><SUB>pe</SUB>
 > <span style='font-family:Symbol'>w</span><SUB>ce</SUB></I> ) plasma [27]. At the reactor
level of temperatures ~10 keV, EBW CD efficiency 
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>h</span> ~ 0.1
would become compatible with other CD methods so a combination
of different CD techniques with different accessibilities
to the plasma may become beneficial.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>6. Summary</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>The TE programme is aimed at developing the ST as a future
power source. Areas that have a high leverage on the feasibility
of this approach have been identified and are under
study in current R&D. Two such areas are the energy confinement
scaling at high field (3-4 T), and the impact of fusion
neutron irradiation on the properties of HTS rare earth tape
at 20-30 K. Both are under investigation and the data should
be available in the near future. Favourable results could lead
to economic fusion based on modular high gain STs of relatively
small size (<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I> < 1.5 m); less favourable results could
lead to larger but still economic ST fusion power plants of
around 1.5-2 m major radius. In either case, the small scale
of the fusion modules should lead to rapid development and
make possible the resolution of the remaining key outstanding
physics and technology steps that are needed for the realisation
of fusion power.
