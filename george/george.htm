I was born on 18th September 1900 at Richmond in Surrey. My father was employed there as a butcher, but in about 1906, he purchased a business at 33 High Street, Beckenham, Kent and my first recollection of life was when we arrived at that address and I was intrigued by the seat around the bay window in the kitchen. 
The house had no garden and the back was asphalted with 3 horse stables which we now no
longer used for the purpose. On the ground floor was the shop, the dining room,
kitchen, scullery and toilet. On the first floor were the sitting room, 2
bedrooms, bathroom and toilet. On the top floor were three more bedrooms. My
parents had the large bedroom on the 1st floor, and I had the smaller. My
sister Ethel and a maid had bedrooms on the top floor. Ethel and I went to the
Elementary School, which was only about 100 yards away up Church Hill and near
the parish of St George's. My parents attended the church and Ethel and I also
joined the Sunday School on Sunday afternoons. A few years later, I think, a
small daughter church was opened at Clock House about a mile away towards Penge
at which my parents attended and were in the choir. The parson in charge was the
Rev. Ritson who used to preach very long sermons up to 40 minutes.</p>

When I was 10 years old I passed a scholarship exam for the Beckenham County Grammar
School at Clock House and started there in 1911. The Head Master was Mr.
Watts. One of the masters at the
elementary school was a Mr. Rees who was also a musician and lived in Cromwell
Road and where Ethel and I walked and had piano lessons once a week for about
4 or 5 years. I am afraid I did not practice very much and made slow progress.

<P>When I was about 11 years old I joined the choir at St Georges, which consisted
of at least 20 boys and about 24 men. The organist was Mr. G. F. Hall FRCO who
was an excellent choirmaster and organist and on Sundays we want Choral Matins
at 10.30 am, Choral Eucharist at 11.30am and Evensong at 6.30pm. 
The music for the Choral Communion was
always sung to a setting and included works by Gounod (Messe Somelle at
Christmas and Messe de Paques at Easter) and also Mozart in Bb, Schubert in G
as well as settings by Stanford, Stainer, Harwood, Smart and many others. At
Easter and Christmas we were assisted by 2 well-known and leading trumpeters
and a timpanist so it became quite an occasion with a crowded congregation. I
made rapid progress in the boy's choir and was soon promoted to the 1st
Chorister on the Cantoris side. I also occasionally sung solos but the normal
soloist was Taffy Williams who had a glorious voice. We also had a
professional tenor in the choir and 3 male altos. When my voice broke when I
was about 15 years I continued in the choir as an Alto and later as a
Bass.

As a young boy I spent a lot of spare time playing with wooden bricks and lead toy
soldiers on the table in the kitchen. In the summer days I often played at
shooting goals with a ball in the back yard. I was also at the time very
friendly with a boy about my own age - Willie Overton - whose father ran a milk
shop about 100 yards away.I had a
very enjoyable time at the County School although the latter years were during
the 1st World War. I did well at sports and was made head Prefect of on of the
four "Houses"; into which the school was divided. The houses competed
against each other at sports: football, Hockey, Cricket and Tennis. Towards the
end I also played in the School 1st XI at Football and Cricket. I also wan the
School Championship Cup for Swimming. During my last year 1917 I went in for
the Matriculation Exam which consisted of five subjects in which you had to
pass in allow of them to get your "Matriculation";. Unfortunately I
failed in French and so was unsuccessful.

I left school later that year and was able to get a job as a temporary clerk 
in the Admiralty on 25th June 1917, where I
stayed until after the war until 21 April 1921. I then entered for what was called
the Lytton Exam for Clerical Officers in the Government. I was mostly for
demobbed soldiers and I was successful in passing very high up so get an early
appointment which gave me high seniority. I was appointed to the Accountant
General's Department of the Post Office and stationed at the GPO North were
they had a very good and large luncheon club on the top floor which was very
convenient, good, and reasonably priced. I was very happy there and made many
good friends.

About this time I also applied to join the Royal Choral Society
and joined them after a successful audition and stayed 3ith them for nearly 50
years until 1969. Sir Frederick Bright was the first conductor but was getting
old and retired in about 1924. For 3 seasons we had various guest conductors so
that I had the pleasure of singing under all the leading conductors including
Sir Edward Elgar with whom I sang Gerontius. Dr Malcolm Sargent was appointed
permanent conductor in 1927 and continued until his death in 1967. He was a
great conductor with an electric personality and during that time the choir
became very famous and the Albert Hall was filled for most of our concerts.
After his death we had guest conductors for a year but then Win Morris was
appointed but after a season I could stand him no more so I resigned. He had no
magic or inspiration and wasted a lot of time with physical exercises at
rehearsals.

To return to 1920, about that time a Concert Party was formed by Mr. Walter Bell
who sang tenor in the Parish Church choir and I was invited to join as a
baritone. Ken Bell - son of Walter - who I know at school was the pianist and
an excellent one, Mildred Pritchard a very good soprano, Walter Bell was tenor,
Clifford Brewster - also a school mate of mine - was comedien and Maude
Dinsdale was an excellent soubrette. Her husband Aubrey Secretan was producer
and we gave many concerts very successfully for about 3 years when Cliff
Brewster became ill and before long we ceased. Whilst we lasted we were a most
happy and successful party.</p>

To go back to about 1920. I started
to have organ lessons from Mr. Hall at Beckenham Parish Church and soon made
such good progress that after a year he waived my lesson fees and in return I
became his deputy. This involved playing for a children's Choral Eucharist at
9.30 am every Sunday when the music was always sung to Merbecke's setting and
also for the Children's Sunday afternoon service at 3.00 pm. I also played for
all service whilst Mr. Hall was on holiday during the whole of August, which
meant a total of 5 services each Sunday and Evensong each weekday except on
Saturdays at 5.30pm.

In 1923
a vacancy for organist and Choirmaster occurred at St Mary's Parish Church at
Shortlands - about 2 miles from Beckenham and on Mr. Hall's recommendation I
was appointed on a three months trial after which I was accepted. The organ was
a 3 manual, tracker action, electrically pumped one made by Hills -a very
reputable firm at that time. The choir at first was only fair but I was quickly
able to raise its size and standards to about 16 boys and 14 men which was the
maximum which the stalls could accommodate. We had a Choral matins and Evensong
each Sunday when the canticles in each case were usually sung to settings and
during Passion Week we generally did a Cantata such as Stainer's
"Crucifixion"; and Harold Moor's "The Darkest Hour", which
became very popular and attracted large congregations. I also managed to raise
the choral standard particularly of the boys and to produce a succession of
excellent boy soloists during the 15 years I remained there. After a few years
arrangements were made for the organ action to be changed to tabular pneumatic
which was very successful and a great improvement as the touch was as light as
a piano. The Vicar was Canon Knight who was a real gentleman of the old school
who gave me a completely free hand in all the music. It was a loss to the
Church when he died about 10 years after my appointment. The congregation was
rather posh. One of the Churchwardens was as "Sir"; and the other a
Colonel and the turnout at Matins especially was always very good. After Canon
Knight's depth we had a new vicar for about 4 years who was not musical but did
not interfere and later another vicar who was musical - in fact he could play
the organ - but I felt did not give me such support as I previously had. In
1939 I was married with a second child and I decided that my organists job
prevented me from spending as much time with my family as I would wish, so I
resigned much to the intense disappointment of the whole choir which whom I had
always got on so well. I look back on the 16 years whilst I was organist, and
choirmaster at St Mary's with nostalgic happiness. I should add that I sat and
obtained my LGSM at the Guildhall School of Music where I had lessons from Mr.
Wetton in July 1928 and my ARCO from The Royal College of organists in July
1930.</p>

To go back again to about 1922, I joined the Cedars Lawn Tennis Club whose ground with
about five grass courts and a pavilion was at Elmer's End about 2 miles from my
home at Beckenham. Mr. Walter Bell was the Secretary and Ken and Dalton Bell
and Cliff Brewster were also members so we were able to make a regular
foursome.

In my job as a Clerical Officer in the GPO some vacancies in the Executive officer
Grade appeared about 1930 and I was promoted to the grade.
It involved transfer to the Postmaster's
Balances Branch in the main Post Office building. At that time I become
friendly with a Mabel Rayment who was know to colleagues as Ray. She worked on
the same floor of the GPO as I did and in 1932 we became engaged and were
married at St Mary's Church at Shortlands on 1st July 1933. Of course we had a
full choral Service and I trained my boy soloist at that time Eric Eagles to
sing "Where ere you Walk", by Handel. My tennis and concert party
friend Ken Bell, who was also an
organist played the organ for the ceremony and which was attended by many of
the local congregation and will as our friend and all went extremely well. We
later had a Social Gathering with refreshments for all at the Church hall in
Shortlands village and later Ray and I left in our car for our honeymoon at a
posh hotel overlooking the sea at Newquay where we had a wonderful time.

<p>We had brought a very nice 3-bedroom
detached house at 6, Hayes Chase, West Wickham. It was a new house and we had
to organize the garden as well as the house. It was about 1 mile away from
Bromley South Station from which I used to journey to London. Ray was very
musical and sang and played the piano very well. She joined the Royal Choral
Society until our first child Delia was born on May 1935. In June 1938 our son
Colin was born and we both enjoyed and loved them both. </p>
