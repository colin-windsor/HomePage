I have been deputising on the church organ ever since the 1960s at Steventon Church.
I was choirmaster at Goring Church for several years in the 1980s. Now I sing at St Mary's
Streatley where my wife Mo Windsor is organist. However I would be available to play for 
occasional Sunday services, or other occasions.
