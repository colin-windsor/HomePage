<H2>Pulsed Neutron Scattering, Taylor and Francis, 1981 </H2><FONT size=4>
<P>Thermal neutron scattering is an important technique which is finding a 
multitude of applications in solid-state physics, chemistry, biology and 
technology. Pulsed neutron sources offer up new areas of investigation, since 
they give neutron energies over a broad range not confined to the Maxwellian 
distribution of reactor thermal neutrons. However the techniques used with 
pulsed neutrons are very different from those of reactor neutron scattering. The 
pulsed sourse demands the use of time-of-flight techniques and new methods of 
analysis. </P>
<P>This is the first book on pulsed neutron scattering and is intended as 
handbook for those wanting to use this new technique. It attempts to provide all 
a research student needs to know in the way of background knowledge on how the 
sources work, and gives full details of all the main pulsed experimental 
techniques and the analysis of results. It also contains a detailed comparison 
with reactor performance. </P>
<H2>Four Computer Models, Avebury House, Goring, RG8 OAS, 1983 </H2><IMG

<P>"This pack contains a remarkable set of programs considering the limitations 
of 1K memory in the unexpanded Sinclair ZX81. The four models are: (1) 
gas-liquid transitions with variable numbers of particles, (ii) two-dimensional 
Ising model; (iii) variable range linear Ising model; and (iv) percolation 
theory.</P>
<P>I found the first program most interesting: phenomena that could be explored 
included quenching to a glass, annealing, melting and supercooling. The fourth 
program was fascinating, but less obviously useful. The other two programs would 
need more time than I was able to devote, to delve into their theory. The 
documentation is first class, consisting of a 58-page booklet that covers the 
topic thoroughly from a review of modelling techniques and the Monte Carlo 
method, to detail of the Z80 machine code programming used. A Sinclair Spectrum 
version is available at the same price." Review by John Freeman in Physics 
World. The book was translated into Russian </P>

by Weaire and Windsor, Adam Hilger, 1987</STRONG></FONT></P><IMG 
src="BOOKS_files/ssscov.jpg" align=right> 
<P>This book traces the history, present achievements and future potential of 
the science of the solid state. The contributors come from various areas within 
the subject and have been chosen to provide a balanced overview, accessible in 
part or in whole to a wide readership. The Editors see a need to affirm the 
identity, unity and importance of solid state science, a subject which within 
the last twenty years has replaced nuclear physics and radiocommunication as the 
branch of physical science most affecting our daily lives. Whilst it has become 
a cliche to speak of the "Age of Silicon", how many people understand how our 
present devices came to be invented and in what directions they ore evolving at 
the present time? The topics covered range from the prehistory of solid state 
physics, diffraction and electrons at the Fermi surface to superconductivity, 
solid state optics and microelectronics. This book will give undergraduates, 
postgraduates and lecturers in solid state science an insight into the 
background of their subject and will also be of interest to professional 
physicists, engineers, scientists in related fields and science policy 
makers.</P></FONT>
