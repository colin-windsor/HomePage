<P><B>Abstract:</B></P>Ground penetrating RADAR has become an important tool in 
anti-personnel mine detection. In general a buried object can be detected by 
scanning the ground surface with the radar probe. An object whose size is 
comparable with a typical wavelength (0.1m @ 1 GHz) gives rise to a complex 
reflection pattern consisting of a superposition of inverted hyperbolic arcs in 
three dimensions (3-D). Previous papers have described the codes which use the 
gradient information in the scattering data to replace each overlapping arc by 
an "apex point" describing the 3-D position, amplitude and sign of each arc. 
This paper introduces the concept of a "pendant": a series of reflections whose 
apexes lie close to a vertical column which may be identified as arising from a 
single object. The amplitudes of these reflections may be used a features for 
object classification. The method is demonstrated using radar images from a 
buried isolated mine and also in proximity with other objects. The aim of this 
classification scheme is the identification of one object (mine) type against 
more "point-like" signals from "clutter" objects small compared to the 
wavelength.

<P>1. Introduction</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=3>
<P>A scanned ground penetrating RADAR beam gives rise to a complex 3-D pattern 
of scattered intensity when reflected by a buried object. While there has been 
much work on the detection and location of buried objects <SUP>(1)(2)(3)</SUP>, 
it would be highly desirable to be able to distinguish the mines from the welter 
of other benign buried objects that can give a significant reflected intensity. 
A problem is that human interpretation is difficult because of the large 
quantity of information that needs to be displayed. This classification problem 
has been already tacled with several techniques by other authors 
<SUP>(4)(5)(6)</SUP>. For example a mine buried 10 cm deep in sand and scanned 
using a 2 cm raster may show signals over 20 cm in both directions. Neither a 
single plot of range along a scan (B-scan) nor signal amplitude at a given range 
(C-scan) provide more than a fraction of the useful information available in 
3-D.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Classification is possible 
because of the relatively large size of most mines compared to the wavelength, 
and compared to the size of many other strongly reflecting objects. The incident 
RADAR pulse usually contains a wavelet with only a couple of maxima, but the 
reflected pulse from a mine is composed of a superposition of reflections from 
the various mine interfaces, including some multiple reflections, and is likely 
to contain at several maxima whose relative intensities are characteristic of 
the particular mine. <IMG src="minesvclutter_files/fig2.jpg" align=right> <FONT

<P>Figure 2: An example of the reflected amplitude (grey scale) as a function of 
range (time of flight) and position along the scan (X) for several parallel 
scans (Y).</P></I></FONT>
<P>Figure 1 shows how the data used in this paper were obtained at the 
LAMI-DETEC institute<SUP>(7)</SUP>. The 1 GHz source was scanned over a box 1.5 
m deep and filled with sand or earth. Typical values for the central wavelength 
at 1 GHz in an average soil is 10 cm. Various objects were placed in the box at 
known positions and depths. Raster scans were performed with the reflected 
intensity as a function of time, being recorded along a 1 m long path along the 
X-direction. The position of the antenna in contact with the ground was then 
stepped by 2 cm in the Y direction, perpendicular to the original scan. In this 
way a series of acquisitions along parallel planes are devised and this form a 
3-D data set, as shown in Figure 2.</P>
<P>An example of typical B-scan containing reflections from a mine buried in 
sand is also shown in figure 2. The strong black flat reflection at the top is 
the "main bang" indicating the reflection from the surface of the sand. Its 
range can be used to calibrate the depth. The mine shows up as a series of 
inverted hyperbolic arcs, whose apex defines the lateral position of the mine 
along the scan, and whose range defines both the depth and the vertical extent 
of the mine. Regarding the alternation of the signal maxima and minima, Figure 3 
illustrates the way the composite signal shown in figure 2 at each probe 
position, might be constructed from the various planar interfaces of the mine 
and perpendicular to the probe vertical axis. Reflections from the upper and 
lower surfaces occur with various defined amplitudes and phases according to the 
dielectric properties of the materials. In addition there may be significant 
multiple reflections. The summation of all these signals gives rise to a complex 
waveform containing several "ripples". The separation of the peaks is roughly 
constant being determined by the wavelength. Their amplitude and phase is 
characteristic of the structure of the mine(8). A small but strongly scattering 
object, such a piece of scrapnel a few centimetres across, gives a reflected 
signal whose profile is much more like the incident wave, and so is easily 
distinguished.</P><IMG src="minesvclutter_files/fig3.jpg" align=right> <FONT

<P>2. The location of hyperbolic arcs and their apex points</P></B></FONT>
<P>The new approach pursued in this work for the classification of buried object 
is the notion of tridimensional contrast pattern derived from the acquisition of 
3-D data. This contrast pattern is generated in the most simple case of a 
point-like object buried at position (x<SUB>0</SUB>,y<SUB>0</SUB>, 
z<SUB>0</SUB>), by the amplitudes of the scattered signals at different times of 
flight (TOF) gathered at surface positions (x,y, 0) with a Radar probe:</P>TOF= 
2*[(x-x<SUB>0</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP> +(y-y<SUB>0</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP> 
+z<SUB>o</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>]<SUP>1/2</SUP>/V 
<P></P>
<P>where V is the propagation velocity of the medium.</P>
<P>The range can be easily derived from the previous TOF equation by assuming V 
constant, which is true for a homogeneous medium. The contrast patterns appear 
as stacked hyperbolic functions in the x,y,TOF representation due to the 
alternations of positive and negative peaks of the scattered signals. The 
proposed algorithm is aimed to extract the hyperbolic contrast patterns from the 
3-D data set that will be used to retrieve essential buried object 
characteristics from their spatial position, morphology and phase information. 
The exploitation of this concept will be described in the next sections. However 
this task is not trivial considering the following experimental conditions:</P>
<P>1. Limited spatial and bandwidth of the Radar</P>
<P>2. Poor approximation of point-like object</P>
<P>3. Clutter (surrounding debris)</P>
<P>4. Inhomogeneous medium</P>
<P>Regarding the difficult problem of clutter reduction we decided to design an 
algorithm composed of several successive steps in order to reduce progressively 
the problem complexity and to enhance the object characteristic response. The 
problem of automatic hyperbolic arc extraction has been studied for 
two-dimensional images and the results obtained with different techniques on 
simulated and real images have been published.<SUP>(3)(9)(10)</SUP></P>
<P>The processing scheme applied to the available data starts with the 
background removal, which consists in the application of a standard linear 
high-pass filter along the scanning direction. The typical effect is the 
cancellation from the image of the high level pulse reflected at the air to 
ground interface which increases the grey levels dynamic for the useful signals 
(see example in Figure 2). The second processing step is the gradient 
calculation to define the image contrast. The hyperbolic patterns are originated 
from ringing signals and they can be precisely defined by calculating the vector 
gradient using the intensity level <I>f(x,y,z=const)</I> Local properties of the 
3-D image <I>f(x,y,z)</I> are retained and the morphological information of the 
buried object response are estimated by the 3-D gradient. We found this approach 
more robust than other methods based on signal amplitudes. The image contrast<I> 
</I>is defined by the 3-D gradient </P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>f(x,y,z)=(df/dx,df/dy,df/dz).</P>
<P>The partial derivatives have been calculated using the central finite 
differences method. The calculation of the gradient over a mesh provides a 
vector field that can be used to estimate the flux lines. The flux lines 
describe the ridges of the hyperbolic patterns that can be calculated by 
exploiting the change in the sign of the gradient corresponding to local maximum 
or minimum. For example the change of the gradient sign can be determined by the 
convolution of the gradient with a function Q<SUB>T</SUB> defined as: </P>
<P>GS[f(t)] = sign[f'(t) x Q<SUB>T</SUB>(t) where Q<SUB>T</SUB>(t) = 1 if t 
betweem 0 and T/2 </P>
<P>= -1 of t between -T/2 and 0 and = 0 elsewhere</P>
<P>where T is the period corresponding to the Radar pulse central frequency and 
t is a parameter that indicate a position along a flux line.</P>
<P>For a better understanding of how a typical contrast pattern looks like, 
Figure 4 shows the first three contrast patterns found on a PFM mine scan: the 
first and the third pattern are obtained by the negative phase waves and the 
second one with the positive phase 
waves.</P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>The next step is the classification of these patterns by assigning to the 
points belonging to the same pattern a code number and an associated colour. A 
colour bar with number codes will be printed together with the final 
visualization of results for object identification. Finally for data reduction 
only the set of points with cardinality higher than a predefined threshold are 
stored.

to the score and three segments proportional to the variances

indication to the user of the reliability and uncertainty of the object position

<P>The above method has been tested also with some extended objects (size 
comparable to few wavelengths) and it has been assumed an object scattering 
model consisting of a distribution of point-like scatterers on the object 
surface. In particular it has been also verified that contours of sharp objects 
can also be detected because their points give rise to a hyperbolic-like

<P>The apex points located during scan over a mine will generally look as in 
figure 5. The mine itself, being relatively large in the scale of the 
wavelength, will generally give a series of apexes of opposite sign extending 
downwards in depth. The smaller "debris" objects will generally be described by 
just one or two apexes, while larger benign objects such as a coke bottle, may 
again show several apexes.</P><IMG src="minesvclutter_files/fig5.jpg"

zx planes. On the right the palette shows the map of set’s code versus sphere 
colour..</P></I></FONT>
<P>The set of apex points generated from the reflections from a single buried 
object will generally satisfy all of the following conditions.</P>
<P>1. They fall into a vertical column above each other within a specified 
distance tolerance <FONT face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>x=<FONT face=Symbol 
size=4>D</FONT>y of say 0.06 m </P>
<P>2. The vertical spacing between points should fall, within a specified 
tolerance <FONT face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>z, of a constant distance equal to 
half the wavelength <FONT face=Symbol size=4>l</FONT> within the medium. 
Typically <FONT face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>z is say 0.015 m for a wavelength of 
around 0.1 m</P>
<P>3. "White" high phase apex points must alternate with "black" low phase 
points</P>
<P>The phase of each part of the reflection is a key variable in its use for 
pendant location. Since the main bang in this series of measurements was 
"white", the extraction was started by searching for the most intense white apex 
point within the image. If the weight of this reflection lay above a specified 
threshold, the point was confirmed as the start of a potential pendant series. A 
search over all "black" points in the image was then made, at deeper depths for 
points present within the allowed volume defined by the current values of <FONT 
face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>x, <FONT face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>y, <FONT 
face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>z and <FONT face=Symbol size=4>l</FONT>. These 
volumes are denoted by the small rectangles in figure 6. The optimal value of 
<FONT face=Symbol size=4>l</FONT> was later refined by evaluating a running 
total of the accepted vertical spacings. Generally only one point in the image 
satisfied the criteria. However in case more than one point was within the 
allowed volume, the one whose distance was closest to the predicted position was 
taken. If at least one point was found the extraction continued, but with the 
phase of the search changed to look for the next deeper white point. If no point 
was found within the currently specified volume, the search still deeper was 
abandoned. The extraction then continued from the original most intense point, 
but to more shallow depths. The volume definition parameters used were <FONT 
face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>x=0.015m, <FONT face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>y=0.015m, 
<FONT face=Symbol size=4>D</FONT>z=0.015m and <FONT face=Symbol 
size=4>l</FONT>/2=0.045m.</P><IMG src="minesvclutter_files/fig6.jpg"

<P>Many of the noise reflections gave only a single point in the pendant series, 
corresponding to an object small compared to the wavelength. However several of 
the reflections gave rise to a series of up to 5 apex points of alternating 
sign. The weights of each point of the series have been divided by their average 
weight so that the patterns are unaffected by absolute changes in contrast. The 
first white point is generally the largest, and is often preceded by a single 
black point and followed by a black, a white, and sometimes a further black 
point. Five feature parameters were therefore chosen for classification in this 
study. They were the weights of the leading black, principal white, next black, 
next white and next black, divided by their average weight.</P><B><FONT

<P>4. The training and test data used to classify mines from other 
objects</P></B></FONT>
<P>The data at our disposal consisted of scans over PMN mines at varying depths 
in sand and in earth, and a test scan containing a PMA mine, a metal ring and a 
bottle, all giving relatively intense signals compared with the noise level.The 
two mimicking landmines used in the laboratory<SUP>(7)</SUP> are very similar 
and they have the following characteristics: PMA-3 cylindrical mine with 
diameter 10 mm, height 50 mm, RTV filled; PMN diameter 112 mm, height 56 mm. PMN 
mine half filled with the replacing silicon. There were four scans over sand, 
with a PMN mine at depth 1, 3, 5, and 10 cm. In these cases the PMN mine being 
the only significant object in each scan and all gave clear pendants. The three 
scans over earth had the mine at 3, 5 and 10cm depth. The mine signal was always 
clear but in earth it was together with other several smaller signals that could 
also be classified as noise objects. All the mines gave good pendants similar to 
that in figure 6. These 7 scans over mines formed the basis of the training 
data. The quality of the data can be seen from the first seven (solid line) 
traces in figure 7 which show the five normalised feature parameters for the 
mine pendants at different depths in sand and earth.</P><IMG

<P>The test data consisted of a set of scans over an earth tray containing 
several objects. One was a PMA mine, one a ring of metal, and one a bottle. All

mine, the metal ring has only 3 features and the bottle only one.</P>
