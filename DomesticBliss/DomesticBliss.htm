<P>On 23/8/19, in Glasgow for the wedding of Dom and Lisa, we visited the Museum of Modern Art and greatly enjoyed the top-floor exhibition on "Domestic Bliss". One section had photos that touch on homelife and domesticity, such as the contents of a kitchen cupboard. It made us realise that such ordinary things and events do indeed make up our domestic bliss, but are rarely recorded. These are our selection.
