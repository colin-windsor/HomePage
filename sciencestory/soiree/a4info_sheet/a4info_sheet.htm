<H2>Looking for buried land-mines with microwave holography</H1>
<H3>
Microwave holography identifies buried objects from the phase difference 
between the incident and reflected waves. Scanning the head over,
say a simulated buried mine gives us a direct visual image.</H2>

<P><B>Why we need better mine detection</B>
<BR>Lady Diana Spencer (figure 1) did the world a great service in publicising the tragedy of anti-personnel land mines. 
In the years since her death we have seen the signing by some countries of the 1998 
"Ottawa treaty" to ban the production of new mines. But not all countries signed the treaty and the 
decade since then has seen a growth in the number of mines in the ground.

Now there are around 100 million buried land mines in 78 countries around the world. 
They cause around 15,000 casualties  each year, mostly civilians including many children. 
Around half the casulaties die. The other half live maimed lives. 

It cost about $10 to make a landmine but about $500 to remove it from the ground. 
At the present level of funding, and the present methods of location, it will take hundreds 
of years to remove them all. 

<P><B>Methods of detecting buried anti-personnel mines </B>
<BR>Sadly mines have become more difficult to detect over the years as the manufacturers seek to make them 
undetectable by the existing methods. Figure 2 shows a typical PMA2 modern mine, 69 mm in diameter, 
and made from plastic with only a tiny pin of metal. There are two main methods used today
so search for buried mines. Metal 
detectors are much used by the sappers for mine detection. 
<img src="pmamine.jpg" alt="Figure 2: A typical anti-personnel mine 7 cm in diameter" ALIGN="LEFT"></td>
These are much the same as those used by treasure hunters today.
Often an audible sound is heard when metal is near. But battlefields are notoriously full of bits of
metal. Any sign of a signal and the sapper must lie down and use, say a prodding stick as in figure 3, to 
help define the cause of the signal. There will be many false alarms, but if it is the right
shape the sapper must try to dig the object out. It is dangerous work - around one sapper is killed
per 1000 mines recovered.

<BR>Many other methods have been tried but no others are widely used. Any new method needs to 
<BR>(i) have a high probability of detection for any type of mine
<BR>(ii) have a low false alarm rate for any other clutter present 
<BR>(iii) relatively cheap to be affordable in war-ravaged countries
<BR>(iv) be usable by local non-expert personnel without too lengthy training

<BR>Ground penetrating radar does a reasonable job with the first two criteria above, 
but conventional pulsed radar equipment is expensive at around $30,000 and this has limited its use.
Also the raw pulse echo data do not present an easy interface with an untrained user.
The invention of microwave holography offers a chance of completing the second two criteria.
It has similar or better performance, it cost only around $5,000 and in particular a manual scan 
of the microwave head over the surface can give a direct image of the buried objects 
that can be easily interpreted.

<BR>Figure 4 shows in blue and incident electromagnetic wave travelling to the

An interference signal may be defined which depends only on depth and is the product of the

a function of distance" ALIGN="RIGHT"></td>
<P><B>How microwave holography works</B>
<BR> The mathematics is very simple.
Suppose an incident wave at the source to the left of the figure
<I> y<SUB>0</SUB> = cos (2<FONT FACE="Symbol">pn</FONT>t + <FONT FACE="Symbol">q</FONT><SUB>0</SUB>).</I>
Here <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">n</FONT></I> is the frequency and <I>t</I> the time.
<I><FONT FACE="Symbol">q</FONT><SUB>0</SUB></I> is some unknown phase angle.  
<BR> The scattered wave will be going in the reverse direction and when it returns to the source
will have a phase difference equal to twice (because it goes there and back) the distance <I>d</I>
to the obstacle, divided by the wavelength, which is equal to <I>V/2<FONT FACE="Symbol">pn</FONT></I>,
 where V is the velocity in the medium:
<I>y = cos (2<FONT FACE="Symbol">pn</FONT>t + 4<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT>d/V + <FONT FACE="Symbol">q</FONT><SUB>0</SUB>).</I>
<BR>To define the interference signal it is necessary to multiply the incident and reflected amplitudes
at the source point and average over time. The unknown phase angle 
<I><FONT FACE="Symbol">q</FONT><SUB>0</SUB></I> disappears and the resulting signal is
 <I>A(d) = cos (4<FONT FACE="Symbol">pn</FONT>d/V)</I>.
<BR> A diagram of this interference function as a function of the obstacle distance  <I>d</I>,
for several different frequencies <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">n</FONT></I> is shown in figure 5.
The wavelength of the oscillation decreases as the frequency increases.

<P><B>The RASCAN system for microwave holography </B>
<BR>The RASCAN system developed over many years by the Bauman Moscow Technical University in Russia.
Figure 6 shows the scanning head being used on a sand bed containing an 
aluminium plate, as illustrated in figure 7. The plate was inclined so that it dropped by around 85 mm in 300 mm. 
 
This therefore simulates the simple distance scan which we described above. The sand is covered 
with a plastic sheet
ruled with lines 10mm apart and the manual scan consists of moving the head along each of these
lines. A small wheel behind the head measures the distance travelled by the head along the scan and
defines the distance travelled. At say 10 mm intervals, a  signal is measured with two polarisation directions,
parallel to the scan and perpendicular to the scan. This can be very useful in identifying the nature
of the reflected object, but will not be discussed here.

<img src="aldscan.jpg" alt="Figure 9: The best signal from the five frequencies shown as a function of distance" ALIGN="RIGHT"></td>
<BR> The RASCAN images are recorded at five different frequencies. Figure 8 shows a sum of 
a 4.0 GHz image coloured red, a 3.9 GHz image coloured yellow, a 3.8 GHz image coloured green, 
3.7 GHz image coloured blue and a 3.6 GHz image coloured violet. The edge of the plate was about half way down the image,
 so that the upper half of the 
image is simply background. However the oscillatory signals from the sheet are clearly seen in the
lower half of the figure. The image closely 
resembles the optical interference pattern as seen by a slightly inclined glass plate.
We often call the characteristic pattern from inclined surfaces the "zebra effect". 
By averaging several of scans together a more precise definition of the depth-dependence of the 
five frequency scans can be obtained as in figure 9.

<P><B>A search for simulated mines using microwave holography </B>
In order to evaluate microwave holography in the task of searching for mines a test bed was dug
in the garden of the Department of Electronic Engineering at the University of Florence, Italy
as in figure 10.
In the test bed were buried several simulations of mines, as shown in figure 11. 
The test bed was scanned manually using both microwave holography and also conventional pulsed 
radar. The holographic radar results are shown in figure 12. The two clear images to the left
are in fact tobacco cases, simulating metallic mines. That to the top right is a plastic object 
simulating a plastic mine, and is also clearly seen but with a distinct colour indicating a different
phase change. The image to the lower right is the PMA2 mine shown in figure 2.
