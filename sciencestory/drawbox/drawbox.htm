As a child Colin made this wooden drawing box from a nice lens that his father had given him, a mirror and 
a piece of glass. You put some tracing paper on the glass and drew the picture projected on to
the screen.

<P>The house at 8 Holland Way was built on a slope and the following pictures show the balcony
and the view of the house and balcony from the end of garden. We bought the house in 1948,
the year of the Olympic Games in London and the balcony design refects the Olympic logo.

The view of the house shows the big area under the house which opened out to cover all the rooms
of the main floor. It made a great play area for me, with a ping pong room, a theatre room
and later a work room. Colin's bedroom is upstairs on the right with three windows.
On the right of the garden is the chicken shed whose flock kept us in eggs. 


<P>Here are two views of Colin's bedroom. It was a nice big room with three windows. 
There is my desk where I did all my swotting, and
the little two-bar electric fire which was our heating. I often sat in that chair in the position
shown just in front of the fire.
