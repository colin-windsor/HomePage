<p ALIGN=center>WHO NEEDS PULSED NEUTRON SCATTERING?</U>
<p ALIGN=center>A series of seven introductory talks by

<P>Mon.  3rd April 1978    
<BR>What can we get from neutron scattering?
<BR>An introduction to neutron scattering avoiding any restriction to thermal neutrons.
<P>Wed.  5th April 1978    
<BR>How do pulsed sources work?
<BR>Special emphasis on the Harwell Linac (1973) and the Rutherford SNS (1982).
 
<P>Mon. 10th April 1978
<BR>Pulsed sources versus reactors?
<BR>An analysis of the performance of pulsed sources compared to reactors.

<P>Wed. 12th April 1978
<BR>Who needs high Q diffraction?
<BR>Elastic spectrometers;  liquid and amorphous solids; powders;  crystals.

<P>Mon. 17th April 1978
<BR>Who needs low Q inelastic scattering?
<BR>Inelastic instrumentation;  vibrational spectroscopy.

<P>Wed. 19th April 1978
<BR>Can we exploit the pulses?
