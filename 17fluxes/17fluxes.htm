<P>The neutron and gamma ray fluxes within the shielded high-temperature superconducting central 
columns of proposed spherical tokamak power plants have been studied using the MCNP 
Monte-Carlo code. The spatial, energy and angular variations of the fluxes over the shield and 
superconducting core are computed and used to specify experimental studies relevant to radiation 
damage and activation. The mean neutron and gamma fluxes, averaged over energy and angle, 
are shown to decay exponentially through the shield and then to remain roughly constant in the 
core region. The mean energy of neutrons is shown to decay more slowly than the neutron flux 
through the shield while the gamma energy is almost constant around 2 MeV. The differential 
neutron and gamma fluxes as a function of energy are examined. The neutron spectrum shows 
a fusion peak around 1 MeV changing at lower energies into an epithermal E<SUP>-0.86</SUP> variation and 
at thermal energies to a Maxwellian distribution. The neutron and gamma energy spectra are 
defined for the outer surface of the superconducting core, relevant to damage studies. 
The inclusion of tungsten boride in the shield is shown to reduce energy deposition. 
A series of plasma scenarios with varying plasma major radii between 0.6 and 2.5 m was 
considered. Neutron and gamma fluxes are shown to decay exponentially with plasma radius, 
except at low shield thickness. Using the currently known experimental fluence limitations for 
high temperature superconductors, the continuous running time before the fluence limit is reached 
has been calculated to be days at 1.4 m major radius increasing to years at 2.2 m. This work 
helps validate the concept of the spherical tokamak route to fusion power by demonstrating 
that the neutron shielding required for long lifetime fusion power generation can be accommodated 
in a compact device.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>1. Introduction</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>Investigations with a system code have shown that the use of high temperature superconducting 
magnets in a spherical tokamak may allow an appreciable fusion gain with the comparatively low 
plasma major radius <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=1.35 m [1]. Computations using the Monte Carlo code for N Particles [2,3] 
(MCNP Version 6.1) have shown that the superconducting column of such a tokamak might 
have a manageable heat deposition of order 50 kW [4,5] using a neutron shield of around 0.32 m 
thickness. However, there is concern that radiation damage of the superconductors may limit the 
lifetime of any such plant. At present, there is only limited experimental data on such damage [6], 
and the Vienna TRIGA Mark II reactor [7] used had a fission neutron spectrum not representative 
of a fusion reactor. Experimental HTS lifetime data with realistic neutron and gamma flux energy 
distributions, and the relevant cryogenic irradiation temperatures will not be easy to come by, 
and so flux calculations with associated radiation damage calculations may be the only available 
option for some time. The present studies predict the neutron and gamma ray energy spectra 
relevant to the radiation damage problem in the shielded superconducting core of a fusion plant. 

<P>The simplified radial geometry of the spherical tokamak centre column used in the MCNP 
calculations is shown to the left in figure 1. In the centre is a cylindrical tie-rod of stainless steel 
and radius 0.05 m. Although the tie rod  is divided into a further three surfaces of intermediate 
radius, these were not used for flux tallying. The high temperature superconductor core lies 
at radii between 0.05 m and 0.2 m. It is homogenised in composition and is divided into five 
annular volumes by the four cylindrical surfaces at intermediate radii shown in the figure. 
Between 0.2 m and 0.23 m radius is a vacuum gap inserted to make a thermal shield between 
the cryogenic column at around 20 K and the neutron shield at ambient temperatures. 
The neutron shield is at radii between 0.23 m and 0.55 m, and is made from five annular 
volumes each 0.052 m thick composed of a tungsten carbide or boride alloy, separated by 
four water channels each 0.015 m thick.

<P>The vertical section to the right of figure1 shows how the central core and shield are 
divided by planes into 9 segments of unequal thickness detailed in [5]. The highest and 
lowest segments lie within the external shield.

fluxes have been calculated. The vertical scale has been compressed in the right-hand figure.

<P>MCNP tracks the 14.1 MeV energy neutrons produced near the centre of the plasma 
and follows the neutrons, photons, protons and alpha particles produced by elastic scattering 
and inelastic reactions as a function of their spatial, angular and energy distributions. 
Here it is assumed that the neutrons are produced within a torus of elliptical cross section 
at a major radius of <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=1.35 m with height ±0.14 m , and minor radius 0.0625 m. There is also an outer shield similar 
to the inner shield shown in figure 1 but with thickness 0.37 m, covering radii between 2.15 
and 2.52 m. MCNP tracks the flux of each type of particle as they cross the various tally 
surfaces defined in the model. Here some 60 energy bins were used to define the flux 
distributions, ranging from thermal energies of 10 meV up to 25 MeV in roughly logarithmic intervals.  
In addition, fluxes are collected as a function of the angle at which the particles cross each 
surface. For most computations, just  four angular tallies were used depending on the 
cosine of the angle <span style='font-family:Symbol'>q</span>  between the particle direction and the normal to the surface. 
Fluxes are described by MCNP in terms of the number of particles crossing the surface in 
the given angular and energy bins per source neutron created. Clearly this depends on the 
width of the energy bin, and the area of the surface. In this paper, fluxes will be described 
in units of neutrons per second, per square metre, per MeV. For a plant with 140 MW 
of neutron power, each neutron having an energy of 14.1 MeV or 2.26 x10<SUP>-12</SUP> joules, this 
would correspond to a neutron production rate of 6.19 x10<SUP>19</SUP> neutrons per second.

<P>In sections 2 to 8, two averaged properties are discussed: the energy and 
angle-integrated total flux through the shield, and the mean energy of the angle-integrated 
flux through the shield. Next the energy distributions are presented for both neutrons and 
gammas as a function of the position and nature of the shield. Lastly the angular distributions 
of the neutrons and gammas are detailed. Sections 9 and 10 deal with a new set of 
computations investigating the neutron and gamma flux distributions as a function of the plasma 
major radius for a set of operating conditions where the calculated maximum mechanical stress 
levels are roughly constant at an acceptable level. This enables the approximate lifetime of the 
superconducting core to be estimated as a function of the major radius.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>2. The flux incident on the outside surface of the central column</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>The central column is bounded by a cylindrical surface 0.55 m in radius. This surface records 
particles coming directly from the toroidal neutron source at 1.35 m radius, but also receives 
additional neutron and gamma ray fluxes from particles scattered by the outer shield and by 
particles scattered from within the central column. Figure 2 shows the neutron and gamma ray 
fluxes incident on the mid-plane sector of the central column at heights +/- 0.2 m as a function 
of energy for the four solid angle tallies. Particles entering the core have 
<I>cos<span style='font-family:Symbol'>q</span></I> <0 and those 
leaving it have <I>cos<span style='font-family:Symbol'>q</span></I> >0. Particles within 
60<SUP>0</SUP> of the normal to the surface have <I>|cos<span style='font-family:Symbol'>q</span>|</I> >0.5 and 
those at wider angles than 60<SUP>0</SUP> (which have the same solid angle) have 
<I>|cos<span style='font-family:Symbol'>q</span>|</I> <0.5.   



<P><IMG SRC="17fluxesFig2.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B> Figure 2.</B> 
The neutron and gamma ray fluxes incident on the mid-plane sector of the central column at 
heights ± 0.2 m on a log scale as a function of particle energy on a linear scale.  
The green upper full lines with closed symbols are the neutron fluxes for the ranges of the 
cosine of the angle to the normal shown. The lower blue dashed lines with open symbols are 
for gamma fluxes.
</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>


<P>Figure 2 shows that for energies above 10 MeV the neutron flux is dominant, and that 
the 14.1 MeV fusion neutrons are mostly moving into the core, with much lower fluxes leaving 
the core, possibly having passed through it, or having been created within it. Around 12 MeV 
the situation has reversed and the flux leaving the core is higher as some of the incident 
14.1 MeV neutrons are scattered back inelastically. At 11 MeV and below the neutron flux 
is essentially isotropic. The gamma ray flux is seen to be low at energies above 10 MeV but 
isotropic and to have a comparable or larger flux than the neutron spectrum at energies 
between around 1 and 7 MeV. The angular distributions will be investigated in more detail in 
section 8.


<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>3. The height distribution of the central column flux
</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>The central column was divided into 9 segments so that it is possible to determine the 
vertical dependence of the flux into the central column. The segments were defined in [5] 
and were not equal in height so the fluxes will be defined per m<SUP>2</SUP> of area. It is seen from 
figure 3 that the total neutron fluxes integrated over all energies into and out of the central 
core are comparable. The dashed lines in the figure show fits to the vertical distribution. 
This is seen to have a distribution lying between a Gaussian distribution with a full width at 
half height of 1.74 m, and a Lorentzian distribution with a full width of 1.47 m.  The heavier 
dashed line shows the pseudo-Voigt function - a linear combination of Gaussian and Lorenzian 
distributions [8]. It is shown to give a good fit to the numerical profile with a full-width at 
half height of 1.58 m. It should be noted that these widths are rather lower than the good 
fit to a Gaussian distribution of full width 2.0 m suggested by the vertical distribution of 
deposited energy reported in reference [5].  In the remainder of this paper only the fluxes 
in the central mid-plane region of the core at height from -0.2 to 0.2 m where the fluxes 
are highest will be considered.

The neutron fluxes on to the outer layer of the central column as a function of vertical distance 
along the central column. The lower curves show the neutron fluxes from the plasma side into the 
core and out of the core and are seen to be almost equal. The total flux is well fitted by a 
pseudo-Voigt function between Gaussian and Lorenzian shapes with a full width at 
half height of 1.58 m.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>Figure 4 shows the neutron and gamma fluxes for energies >0.1 MeV at various surfaces 
within the neutron shield and superconducting core. These layers are illustrated at the bottom 
of the figure. The neutron shield is composed of 5 layers of cemented tungsten carbide 
composite with an inner layer optionally of cemented tungsten boride. Between these are 
water-cooling layers. There is a thermal gap of 0.03 m between the shield and the superconducting 
core. Within this the superconducting core is measured at four intermediate surfaces as well as 
its inner and outer surfaces. Only results from the central mid-plane vertical section of the core 
where the fluxes are highest are shown. Figure 4 shows how the flux decreases through the 
neutron shield and becomes nearly constant over the superconducting core. The shield 
attenuation is roughly the same for neutrons and gammas and corresponds to a half-intensity 
attenuation distance of around 0.053 m as shown by the dashed line. 

<P><IMG SRC="17fluxesFig4.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B> Figure 4.</B>
The neutron and gamma fluxes for energies over 0.1 MeV as a function of the radial distance 
through the core. The fluxes crossing each tally surface are given for neutrons and gammas 
and with either an all-tungsten carbide/water (WC) composite shield or one whose inner layer 
is composed of tungsten boride (WB/C) composite. The rectangles at the bottom of the figure 
indicate the various materials and their positions. The dashed line shows a half-intensity 
attenuation distance of around 0.053 m, which is followed generally through the shield for 
both neutrons and gammas.
</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>

<P>For the boride-containing shield, the neutron flux >0.1 MeV in the superconducting layer 
is almost constant at around 1.5 x10<SUP>17</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>m<SUP>-2</SUP>. 
With the all tungsten carbide shield the 
neutron flux is around 20% higher and decreases slightly into the core. The gamma fluxes 
in the superconducting core are generally only around 20% of the neutron fluxes. The flux in 
the boride-containing shield, at around 6 x10<SUP>16</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>m<SUP>-2</SUP> 
is around 30% higher than in the carbide shield. Each <SUP>10</SUP>B neutron capture emits a gamma ray 
of 2.3 MeV energy, which may account for this. However, in the boride-containing layer itself 
the gamma flux is lower than with the all-carbide shield.  


<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>5. The mean neutron and gamma energies
</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>A second averaged figure of importance is the mean energy of neutrons and gammas as they 
pass through the shield and superconducting core. Figure 5 shows this for both tungsten carbide 
and water shields and for those containing an inner layer of tungsten boride. 
	
<P>For neutrons, the average energy drops significantly across the shield. On the outer
 plasma-facing surface the mean energy is 3.53 MeV, significantly lower than the fusion neutron 
energy of 14.1 MeV, as many neutrons are scattered by the surrounding outer shield. In the water 
layers of the shield there is little change in mean neutron energy, indeed, it sometimes rises slightly. 
For the all-tungsten carbide shield, after the first layer, there is a smooth reduction in mean energy 
across the rest of the shield. The dashed line in the figure corresponds to an energy-halving 
distance of 0.43 m.  The mean energy of the neutrons within the boron-containing layer of the shield 
is increased by around 50% above that of the all tungsten carbide shield. This could represent the 
onset of appreciable neutron absorption by <SUP>10</SUP>B as the lower energy neutrons are preferentially 
absorbed.  In both shields the mean neutron energy continues to decrease with decreasing radius 
into the superconducting core and tie-bar.



<P><IMG SRC="17fluxesFig5.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B> Figure 5.</B>
The mean energy of the neutron and gamma fluxes as a function of the radial distance through 
the core. Results are shown for both an all-tungsten carbide composite shield and for one whose 
inner layer is composed of tungsten boride composite. The monitored surfaces are illustrated 
at the bottom of the figure. 
</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>

<P>The gamma energies in figure 5 are seen to be almost constant across the shield at around 2 MeV 
and almost identical between the all tungsten carbide and part boride shields. This is because the 
gammas are largely created by (n,<span style='font-family:Symbol'>g</span>) reactions in tungsten. 
They have a cross section depending on energy but generally emit gammas with a range of energies 
centred around a few MeV. The result is that the average gamma energies are higher than the 
average neutron energies in all but the plasma-facing surface. Within the boride-containing layer 
the gammas are seen to have around 10% lower mean energy than in the all-carbide segment. 
This could be because the <SUP>10</SUP>B (n,<span style='font-family:Symbol'>g</span>) 
capture produces gammas of 2.31 MeV - rather lower than the mean energy from tungsten 
(n,<span style='font-family:Symbol'>g</span>) capture.  


<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>6. The energy and radial dependences of the fluxes</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       


<P>The total fluxes of figure 4 need to be further examined to reveal the dependence of the 
neutron and gamma fluxes as functions of their energy. The flux <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>F</span></I> 
is expressed as the 
differential flux <I>d<span style='font-family:Symbol'>q</span>/dE</I> per unit energy in MeV. This is necessary because the flux is divided into 
energy bins of unequal, approximately logarithmically varying width. With this definition, typical 
reactor neutron fluxes increase with decreasing energy, typically having the epithermal distribution 
nearly inversely proportional to the neutron energy from 1 MeV to around 100 eV, then changing 
to a Maxwellian distribution at thermal energies.
 

<P><IMG SRC="17fluxesFig6.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B> Figure 6.</B>
The neutron differential fluxes for a tungsten carbide and water shield with an inner layer of 
tungsten boride as a function of energy, for the radial surfaces defining the shield and 
superconducting core. The legend shows the radius of  each tally surface, which can be 
correlated with the radial sections at the bottom of figures 4 and 5. The dark red diamonds 
show the outer plasma-facing surface. The orange and green lines correspond to surfaces 
in the shield, and the blue lines correspond to surfaces behind water layers. The heavy violet 
triangles indicate flux at the outer surface of the superconducting core, 
and the purple shaded lines below it the fluxes at the other tally surfaces within the core. 
The dashed line indicates an energy dependence in the differential flux <I>1/E<SUP>0.85</SUP></I> 
when <I>E</I> is 
the energy in MeV, and the full line a simulated Maxwellian distribution at thermal energies 
of 25 meV and including a fast neutron peak decaying with form <I>1/E<SUP>2.42</SUP></I>.
</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>

<P>Figure 6 shows these distributions for neutrons in the tungsten carbide and water shield. 
The energy scale goes from 10 meV, just below thermal energies, to well above the fusion neutron 
production energy of 14.1 MeV. The peak in the energy distribution near 14 MeV is clearly seen 
in the figure, and is maintained to some degree throughout the shield and superconducting core, 
since some fusion neutrons traverse the shield and core unscattered.

<P>Over a broad range of energies from 0.1 MeV down to 0.25 eV there is an almost linear slope 
to the differential flux with an exponent <I>E<SUP>-0.85</SUP></I>, so slightly less steep than the 
epithermal <I>1/E</I> energy distribution. At around 0.4 MeV the epithermal distribution changes into a 
broad fast neutron peak in the differential flux. This peak is maintained without much change in 
shape or relative amplitude at all the surfaces throughout the shield and core. This peak then decays 
at the high-energy end  as <I>1/E<SUP>2.42</SUP></I>.  The full black line in the figure 
shows this fast neutron peak modelled by the function: 
<I>d<span style='font-family:Symbol'>F</span>/dE=AE<SUP>-0.85</SUP>.T(E) +BE<SUP>-2.42</SUP>[1-T(E)] </I>,

 where <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> are amplitudes depending on the surface radius, and <I>T(E)</I> 
is a transfer function depending on the logarithm of the energy of form: 

<I> T(E)=1/{1+exp[ln(E)-ln(E<SUB>T</SUB>)]/ln(W<SUB>T</SUB>)}</I> where the transfer energy
<I> E<SUB>T</SUB></I> and transfer width <I>W<SUB>T</SUB></I> are both about 0.7 MeV. 

<P>An exception to this distribution is the plasma-facing surface shown by the dark red diads. 
This occupies the top of the distributions above 0.01 MeV but its flux decays much faster with decreasing 
energy than the inner surfaces to reach a flux around that at the back of the neutron shield below 15 eV. 
	
<P>Around 25 meV a Maxwellian distribution replaces the epithermal energy dependences. 
In this distribution, the neutrons cease to lose energy on average, as they collide with atoms at 
thermal energies, assumed here to correspond to 300 K or about 25 meV. The Maxwellian distribution 
takes the form:  
<I>d<span style='font-family:Symbol'>F</span>/dE=<span style='font-family:Symbol'>F</span><SUB>0</SUB>(E/kT)<SUP>2</SUP>*exp(-E/kT) </I> 
where <I><span style='font-family:Symbol'>F</span><SUB>0</SUB></I>  is the total flux integrated over all energies 
and is set equal to 10<SUP>18</SUP>  ns<SUP>-1</SUP>m<SUP>-2</SUP> in the figure. It is interesting that there is 
no trace of a Maxwellian distribution at the outer surface of the shield (the dark red diamonds). 
Both sides of the outermost water layer show a clear Maxwellian contribution and this stays much the 
same until the boron-containing shield layer when it disappears completely.

<P>The figure shows the differential flux in the water layers by blue tinted lines. These lie very close 
to the corresponding inner tungsten carbide surface and are difficult to distinguish except near the region 
around 0.4 MeV. This is consistent with the total fluxes shown in figure 4, which only dip slightly in the 
water layers.

<P><IMG SRC="17fluxesFig7.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B> Figure 7.</B>
The figure shows the neutron (full lines and closed symbols) and gamma (dashed lines and 
open symbols) differential fluxes for the mixed tungsten carbide and water shield plotted as a 
function of energy for all the radial surfaces defining the shield and superconducting core.  
The heavy lines indicate the outer edge of the superconducting core. The dashed line 
shows an epithermal neutron distribution and the full line a Maxwellian corresponding to 25 meV 
thermal energies.
</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>

<P>The outside surface of the superconducting core is shown by the heavy violet triangles and line. 
This line defines the maximum fast neutron flux seen by the superconducting core. It is seen that over 
an energy range from 1 MeV to 10 keV the surfaces within the superconducting core have closely 
similar fluxes. Below this energy, the differential flux rises slightly across surfaces inwards towards the 
centre of the superconducting core. This could be because of the increasing distance from the neutron 
absorbing boron layer. This effect is reversed in the all-tungsten carbide shield as shown in the following 
figure 7. However, this low energy range is of little significance for radiation damage.
	
<P>Figure 7 shows the closely similar results for a shield composed of just tungsten carbide composite 
and water. Note that including the gammas, the vertical flux scale is extended to 100 times lower values. 
The neutron fluxes are very different in that the fluxes in the previously borated shield layer next to the 
core (shown in green) are very much larger. The neutron fluxes within the core extend to much lower 
energies and remain quite flat right down to thermal energies. The clear advantage
of a borated shield layer is evident from the much lower thermal and epithermal neutron fluxes in 
figure 6 compared with figure 7. There is a sharp dip in the flux around 25 meV, not seen with the 
boride containing shield. The origin of this dip remains uncertain. 

<P>The gamma flux is shown by the dashed lines and open symbols with the same colours. It differs 
only slightly from the gamma flux in the tungsten boride-containing shield. While it is generally much lower 
than the neutron flux there is an energy range between 2 and 6 MeV when it is larger. The gamma flux 
attenuates rapidly below 1 keV and above 10 MeV and also drops rapidly to a value five orders of 
magnitude below its peak values around the MeV region. The forms of the spectra are quite different 
from the neutron spectra. They contain several distinct peaks at, for example, near 10 keV, 60 keV 
and 0.6 MeV. This time the water layers are almost identical to the outer carbide layer until below 
10<SUP>-2</SUP> MeV, when the gamma flux is appreciably higher in the water layers.

<P>Again, the fluxes crossing the outer surface of the superconducting core at a radius of 0.2 m are 
shown by the heavy violet lines. Other violet lines indicate surfaces within the superconducting core. In the 
case of neutrons for this shield it generally represents the largest flux seen in the core region with only a 
modest further reduction towards the centre of the superconducting core. In the case of gammas, the 
flux within the core is nearly constant.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>Figure 8 shows the neutron and gamma differential fluxes plotted just for the surface at radius 0.2 m 
defining the outside of the superconducting core. These are the surfaces shown by the violet lines in 
figures 6 and 7, but also include the all-tungsten carbide, boride and water shield results. These results 
define the nature of the radiation spectrum needed to test the lifetime of the high temperature 
superconducting tapes. 
	
<P>It is seen that the presence of the boride-containing layer next to the core makes a considerable 
difference in the neutron flux below 0.1 MeV. The difference increases as the energy is reduced 
and the boron absorption cross-section increases. With the boron-containing shield there is almost 
no flux below 1 eV.

<P>In the case of the gamma flux it is seen that at energies below 1 MeV the neutron flux is higher 
than the gamma flux by an increasing ratio as the energy is reduced. However, over the range 
between 2 and 6 MeV the gamma flux is higher than the neutron flux. The inclusion of the boride-containing 
layer makes  only a modest difference, however the boride increases the gamma flux by a factor 
increasing as the energy is reduced from about 5% at 0.1 MeV rising to a factor five at 0.004 MeV.

anisotropy of the differential flux as a function of radial position through the neutron shield. 
The energy range from 14 to 15 MeV includes the fusion neutrons. Figure 9 shows this energy range 
through a selection of the possible surfaces as a function of radius from the centre of the superconducting 
core. The inwards, close-angle, flux is always higher than the large-angle flux, and much higher that the 
outwards flux, which tends to be over 100 times lower near the centre of the shield. The gamma 
fluxes are negligible for this energy range.

(i) radius 0.498 m on the outside of the first water layer, and (ii) at 0.483 m on the inside 
of this layer. The sample had a tungsten carbide alloy and water shield with an inner layer 
of tungsten boride.

<P>Figure 10 shows the differential flux as a function of energy and angle for (i) the outer side of 
the first water layer at 0.498 m, and (ii) the inner side of this water layer at 0.483 m. Several significant 
differences can be seen.  Around the 0.1 to 1 MeV energy range the inwards neutron flux on the 
outside of the first water layer is around double than of the outward flux, but this difference is 
reduced to only about 50% for the inner side of the first water layer. This 1.5 cm thick water layer is 
therefore highly significant in making the neutron flux less directional. At epithermal energies below 
0.1 MeV the flux is nearly isotropic in both cases.
	
<P>In the case of the gammas, for example around 0.04 MeV, the inwards gamma flux is reduced 
by around a factor  of three from the outside of the first water layer to the inside. However, the 
situation is reversed for the outwards gamma flux which is close to double the inwards flux on the 
inside of the first water layer. Clearly the gammas produced in the tungsten carbide pass into the 
water layer from both directions. 

<P>Figure 11 shows the angle dependent differential fluxes on the outer surface of the superconducting 
core. It is seen that while the neutron flux is largely isotropic below around 1 MeV, there remains 
considerable anisotropy in the flux distribution between around 4 MeV up to and including the 
fusion energy of 14.1 MeV where the two inwards fluxes are around an order of magnitude larger 
than the two outward fluxes. 

<P>The gamma fluxes are largely isotropic at energies down to 0.4 MeV but then develop considerable 
anisotropy with the outwards going flux being an order of magnitude larger than the inwards flux around 
250 keV. At around 60 keV there is a distinct gamma peak due to neutron capture reactions in the shield, 
and the situation is reversed with the inwards flux being an order of magnitude higher.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>9. Neutron and gamma flux changes with plasma major radius
</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       
	
<P>All the above computations have been for a fixed plasma major radius of 1.35 m. If it is essential
 to reduce the flux either because of excessive radiation damage to the superconductors, or because of 
too large a cryogenic heat load, one solution is to increase the plasma major radius. This increase is 
complicated by the fact that in any such radial scan there is wide choice of possible scans, depending 
on which variables are held constant. In the present work, the choice has been made to hold the 
fusion gain constant at 5, the aspect ratio constant at 1.8, and the I<SUB>PB98y2</SUB> H factor 
constant at 1.9. The central temperature was varied to give 0.8 of the Greenwald density limit and 
the toroidal field adjusted to give 0.9 of the beta limit. A further consideration is that the mechanical 
stresses in the tokamak must lie within acceptable limits.  As described in [9], these conditions could 
be satisfied over a wide range of plasma major radii if the increased extra space made available by 
increasing the major radius is divided in the ratio 92% to the shield thickness and 8% to the HTS core 
radius. A series of 13 MCNP computations were made using this fraction from major radius 
<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=0.592 m, where the shield thickness vanishes, to 
<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=2.50 m where the shield thickness is 0.782 m. All runs include a 
constant vacuum gap of 0.015 m and a plasma wall gap of 0.025 m, which are half the thicknesses 
assumed in the earlier results presented here. No allowance has been made for the vacuum vessel 
thickness which would need to be included in a more realistic design. Table 1 shows a selection of parameters 
used in the present radial scan. Another difference is that the superconducting material extends into the 
region previously occupied by a steel tie-bar. The shield material was tungsten carbide composite and 
water without the presence of any boride.

</TABLE>
<FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B> Table 1.</B>
The major parameters of a series of possible tokamaks with increasing major radius. All have a constant fusion gain of 5, 
aspect ratio of 1.8 and H<SUB>IPB98y2</SUB>=1.9, and have reasonable density and beta limits, compressive stress 
and maximum field on the surface of the superconducting core.  The radius of the core <I>T<SUB>con</SUB></I> 
increases slightly with major radius.
</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>


<P>It is seen that the fusion power <I>P<SUB>fus</SUB></I> is roughly constant over the scan, as is the maximum stress. 
Another important parameter is the maximum field at the surface of the superconductor <I>B<SUB>cond</SUB></I> . 
This is seen to vary between 18.9 and 20.3 T, which corresponds to a  feasible level for an HTS material at 30 K temperatures.
	
<P>For all these runs the neutron and gamma fluxes were determined for the four angular bands, 
and as a function of energy, although with only 18 energy bands rather than the 60 used 
previously in this paper.  The results from this series are given in detail in the supplimentary data 
associated with this paper.  Figure 12 shows the  total neutron and gamma fluxes crossing the 
mid-plane region of the outer surface of the superconducting core, integrated over energy, but 
including only fast particles defined as having energies greater than 0.1 MeV, and including all 
particle angles.  It is seen that both neutrons and gammas approach a limiting exponential decay 
at plasma major radii above around 1 m. For neutrons, this limiting slope is 7.08 m<SUP>-1</SUP>, 
as indicated by the short-dashed line in figure 12.  For gammas, the limiting slope is rather 
higher as in the long-dashed line with the slope 7.38 m<SUP>-1</SUP>.

detailed in table 1. Only particles with energies >0.1 MeV have been included, following the 
definition of total flux used in reactor irradiation studies.
</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>

<P>It is clear that at the lowest major radii below 1 m, when the shield thickness falls below 0.16 m,
 that both the neutron and gamma flux are appreciably lower than that expected from the 
exponential variation. At <I>R<SUB>o</SUB></I>=0.592 m where the shield thickness vanishes, 
the flux levels are fractions 0.283 and 0.258 of the expected exponential variation for neutrons 
and gammas respectively. This represents a favourable result since the fluxes are appreciably 
less than might have been expected from extrapolation of results at larger plasma radius. 
The differences can be well modelled by subtracting from the exponential variation 
the function: 5.45x10<SUP>19</SUP>exp[ - 14.56(<I>E<SUB>0</SUB></I>-0.592)] 
for the neutrons and 1.745 x10<SUP>19</SUP>exp[ - 16.25(<I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>-0.6)] 
for the gammas. The solid lines in figure 12 show that a fit to within about 3% can be made 
to the whole flux variation with radius for both neutrons and gammas.
	
<P>In figure 13 the total fast fluxes described in figure 12 are expressed as differential fluxes 
as a function of energy. The full lines and closed symbols represent neutron fluxes and the 
dashed lines and open symbols represent gammas. All fluxes refer to the outer surface of the 
HTS core, and for the mid-plane vertical section where fluxes are highest. The figure is important, 
as was figure 11, in that it describes the fluxes into the outer surface of the superconducting core 
that will determine how the superconductor lifetime may be estimated.  

<P>Generally, the neutron differential fluxes follow those shown in figure 7 that has a higher 
energy resolution. The rather sharp change of gradient of the neutron spectra at 1 MeV is 
clearly shown to be the upper edge of a broad fast neutron peak. This peak is most pronounced 
for major radii less than 0.65 m and then reduces rapidly at higher radii.

<P>The gamma fluxes are appreciably higher than the neutron fluxes over the energy range 
3 to 10 MeV. The difference is approximately a factor five and is maintained at all the 
plasma radii considered from <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=0.6 to 2.5 m. At energies below 
1 MeV they decrease quite rapidly with the differential flux dropping by 10<SUP>3</SUP> for each 
decade of energy.

The total neutron and gamma fluxes at the outer surface of the superconducting core 
shown in figure 13, plotted as a function of major radius for given values of the energy,

fluxes use full lines and closed symbols, the gamma fluxes open symbols and dashed lines. 
The curves have a generally exponential dependence with a roughly constant exponent 
around -6.6 m<SUP>-1</SUP> similar to that shown in the total flux curves of figure 12.
</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>

<P>Figure 14 shows the differential flux variations from 0.1 to 15 MeV in greater detail by 
expressing them as functions of major radius for selected energies. The curve defining the 
14 to 15 MeV band includes the fusion 14.1 MeV neutrons and is seen to fall off relatively 
quickly with radius. However, even by the 14 MeV band the attenuation with radius is close 
to exponential and there is the same dip at low shield thickness that was seen in the 
energy-integrated flux. The magnitude of this dip increases as the energy decreases. 

<P>The gamma flux is naturally very low for 13 to 15 MeV energies but then rises rapidly 
and is some  five times higher than the neutron flux at 10 MeV energies. By 1 MeV it is a 
similar factor lower and by 0.1 MeV a factor 104 lower. Thus, gamma radiation cannot be 
excluded but is quite limited in its energy range.


<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>10. The expected lifetimes of High Temperature Superconductor tapes</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>In any fusion reactor, it is necessary that the HTS tapes withstand the radiation penetrating 
the shield for an acceptable time. Experimental studies to estimate this lifetime [6,10] have 
been performed by placing tapes in the central irradiation facility of the TRIGA Mark II fission 
reactor at the Vienna University of Technology [7]. The neutron dose was estimated by placing 
a nickel foil adjacent to the specimens and calculating the fast neutron fluence (E>0.1 MeV) from 
the activity of <SUP>58</SUP>Co, formed by the neutron capture reaction with <SUP>58</SUP>Ni. 
Experiments were performed up to an irradiation fluence of 3.9x10<SUP>22</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP>. 
The irradiations were carried out at the normal ambient reactor temperature.

<P>After the various irradiations were complete, cryogenic tests of the superconducting properties 
were made. Results showed that the critical current when superconductivity was lost actually 
increased for low fluences of order 10<SUP>22</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP> presumably as 
new magnetic flux pinning sites were created. However at larger doses the critical current and 
critical temperature decreased. 
	 

<P><IMG SRC="17fluxesFig15.jpg"><FONT FACE="Arial" Size=2><P><B> Figure 15.</B>
The expected cumulative running time, at full neutron production rate, before the fluence on the 
mid-plane of the HTS core reaches the value 3.9x10<SUP>22</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP>.  This is the fluence where 
experimental data from fission reactor irradiation studies suggest the tape performance 
deteriorates significantly.  The major radius is changed along with other parameters to allow 
fusion conditions as defined in Table 1. 
</B></font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>


<P>The possible lifetime of the tapes may be estimated as a function of major radius for the 
series of nearly constant stress configurations given in Table 1, by estimating the neutron flux 
for energies >0.1 MeV as given in figure 12 and evaluating the number of seconds of continuous 
tokamak running time before the fluence reaches 3.9x10<SUP>22</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP>.  
Such a plot is given in figure 15. In practice the operating availability for such a first of a kind 
device would be very much less than 100% and as with fission; the best that can be expected 
is in the low 90's. 

<P>These results must be treated with caution because of several important differences 
between the fission reactor and tokamak HTS core irradiations.  The fission reactor irradiation 
temperature was ambient rather than the 20 to 30 K at which  the HTS is expected to run. 
This could mean that the damage creates new stable pinning centres, which could improve 
the superconducting properties, but there could be effects in the other direction; for example, 
the fluence at which the critical current begins to degrade could  reduce. These effects may 
be annealed out during higher temperature irradiation. It is also important to note that the 
neutron and gamma fluxes from the fission reactor are likely to have different energy spectra 
from those behind the shield of the tokamak. The need is for irradiation facilities which could at 
least approximately reproduce the necessary flux distributions. 


<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><B>11. Conclusions</B></font>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>       

<P>The flux levels and energy distributions of neutron and gamma irradiation on the high 
temperature superconductors of any fusion pilot plant are important because of the possible 
degradation of its superconducting properties at high fluence. Monte Carlo MCNP computations 
have been performed to compute the neutron and gamma fluxes within a 0.2 m radius 
high-temperature superconducting magnet shielded by a 0.32 m thick combination of layers of 
tungsten carbide and an optional tungsten boride layer separated by water cooling layers. 
The major radius for this part of the study was <I>R<SUB>0</SUB></I>=1.35 m and 
corresponded to the pilot plant suggested in [1]. The total neutron flux integrated over energy, 
and over all particle angles was shown to decrease exponentially through the shield with a 
half intensity distance of order 0.055 m. The gamma flux decreases at a similar rate. Within 
the superconducting core the neutron flux is roughly constant as shown in figure 4 with an 
averaged value of order 2.4x10<SUP>17</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>m<SUP>-2</SUP>.  
At this flux level a total neutron fluence of 3.9x10<SUP>22</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP> 
would be achieved in 1.8 days. 

<P>The mean energy of the neutron flux was evaluated and shown to decrease much more 
slowly with a half intensity distance of 0.43 m. The mean energy of the gammas was seen 
to be almost constant over both shield and core with a value of order 2 MeV.

<P>The neutron differential flux as a function of energy is rather flat in the epithermal region 
with an energy dependence of order 1/E<SUP>0.85</SUP>. Above around 0.1 MeV it turns into 
a fast neutron distribution, which falls off steeply in the MeV range with a dependence of order 
1/E<SUP>2.4</SUP>.  The gamma flux is comparable to that of the neutrons in the MeV range 
but falls off rapidly in the keV range. 
	
<P>The inclusion of the tungsten boride layer in the shield results in a strong attenuation of the 
neutrons in the eV range, although this corresponds to only some 20% decrease in the total 
energy-integrated flux. There is a corresponding increase in the gamma ray intensities. 
	
<P>The anisotropy of the fluxes was examined within four tallies of "into" and "out of" the 
core and at "wide angles" and "narrow angles". The anisotropy of 14.1 MeV fusion neutrons was 
shown to extend right through the shield and superconducting core. Gamma rays were shown 
to be preferentially generated in the tungsten part of the shield and to penetrate into the water layers. 

<P>The possibility of longer operating times was examined by performing a series of MCNP 
computations as a function of plasma major radius, designed to give a satisfactory and almost 
constant compressive stress in the core region. This scan, which allowed for an 8% increase 
in superconducting core radius as the major radius increased has been described by 
Sykes et al  [9]. It showed that, given the same neutron fluence limit of 
3.9x10<SUP>22</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP>,  the lifetime of the device can be significanty 
increased from months to years by increasing the plasma major radius from 1.8m to 2.2m. 
This encouraging result helps validate the compact spherical tokamak route to fusion power 
and demonstrates that the neutron and gamma shielding required for reactor relevant 
operational lifetimes can be accommodated in a device of modest size.
