</FONT><P>Always aware of the big application, Windsor was one of the 
first people to try out neural network methods for the prediction of the 
stock market. The idea is to learn from previous experience by getting 
the neural network to assimilate the fluctuations of the market over a 
series of previous years, and so detect a similar pattern if it occurs 
again. There had been a few previous studies of this problem, but 
Windsor's was the first that used multiple indices to predict a chosen 
index. Thus interest rates, money supply, and even the Conservative party 
majority were included in the training data used to predict the FT index. 
The paper and poster attracted enormous interest at the Paris International 
Neural Network Conference in 1990. Many banks and financial institutions 
are now working in this field although naturally the real results are not 
published. </P></BODY>
