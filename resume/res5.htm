</B><P>In the seventies pulsed neutron sources had a serious problem. 
There seemed no place for the triple axis spectrometer, and its ability 
to measure the coherent excitations. These phonons and magnons had been, 
and continued to be, neutron scattering's most important contribution 
to condensed matter science. Windsor's experience with both triple axis 
and time of flight techniques lead him to invent this new spectrometer 
where every channel in a time of flight scan can measure excitations 
at the same scattering vector Q. The prototype machine was quickly built 
during the hot summer of 1976, and it worked [87]. It lead to the 
"High Symmetry Spectrometer," first described at one of the SNS 
instrument discussion groups, but first built as MAX at the KEK source 
in Japan. Windsor was invited to Japan by the late Professor Ishikawa 
to help commission it [82]. It lead in turn to the ISIS PRISMA instrument, 
designed by Sachetti, Andreani and Windsor at the Institute for the 
Structure of Matter at Frascati[124]. It has proved one of the most 
successful of international collaborations [137].</P></BODY>
