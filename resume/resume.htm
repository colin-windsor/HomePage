<P><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="85%"></P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P>Colin Windsor's scientific career has included contributions 
of importance and originality in a series of fields. Indeed every few years, 
having established an international reputation in one field, he has moved on, 
taking insights from the old fields to apply to the new ones. 
Here we take 12 of his papers illustrating this unusual career.</P>
