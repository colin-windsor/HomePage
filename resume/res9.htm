</B><P>Windsor's interest in computer modelling lead to him taking up the 
new home micros directly they came out in 1981[120]. His little book, 
"Four Computer Models" [100] showed Monte Carlo modelling in action 
and fellows may remember him at the 1985 soiree. His programs grew into 
three dimensions, into face centred cubic lattices, and to displays which 
could show the evolution of any one cluster from its nucleation as a 
random cluster to the final equilibrium state. This paper was written 
following a series of commercial experiments for Alan Bowen at RAE 
Farnborough to measure the evolution of the microstructure as a function 
of time and temperature. The material was grown by evaporation of the alloy 
elements onto a cooled substrate, by-passing the limitations of the phase 
diagram. It lead to the novel properties which have been explored in 
several papers [133,142] </P></BODY>
