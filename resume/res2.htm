</B><P>In the years 1965 to 1970, Windsor worked with Ray Lowde on the PLUTO reactor "chopper", a time of flight inelastic spectrometer. It's speciality, which Windsor made his own, was to measure the complete scattering function S(<B>Q</B>,h<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT> ) as a function of the scattering vector <B>Q</B>, and energy transfer h<FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT> the generalised susceptibility in magnet materials. His experiments on paramagnetic nickel enabled this function to be measured in an itinerant magnet for the first time. But the results needed a theory to extract the key information on the Hamiltonian of itinerant magnets. With the help of a French student, Guy Allen, Windsor was able to fit to experiment the response from a tight binding model of nickel and so determine the Hubbard exchange interaction I<FONT SIZE=1>eff</FONT>(<B>Q</B>). The field has continued with measurements and calculations over ever wider temperature and energy ranges.</P></BODY>
