</B><P>A talk by David Wallace at the 1985 Reading IoP conference excited 
Windsor's interest in neural networks. He picked up the subject by himself 
and by 1987 had published papers on the Hopfield model [126, 132]. This 
paper had applied the Hopfield model to the classification of defects 
measured by ultrasonics. Since then the ultrasonic applications of neural 
networks have blossomed world-wide[112]. Harwell obtained the ESPRIT 2 
contract ANNIE for the Application of Neural Networks for Industry in 
Europe, and Windsor was the chairman of its Pattern Recognition Working 
Group, once described by an EEC referee as the jewel in Annie's crown! 
The Harwell group continued the ultrasonic studies eventually leading to 
an on-line demonstrator based on the Harwell ZIPSCAN ultrasonic data 
collection system. This system would scan over a weld defect, and 
immediately classify it by both conventional and neural network methods. 
It was one of four projects chosen by the EEC to represent ESPRIT 2 at the 
Avignon Expert Systems Exhibition in 1991[152]. </P></BODY>
