<P>Windsor's interest in the effects on band structure on material 
properties lead to a long collaboration with Bosio's group in Orsay, Paris. 
They were expert in liquid gallium - a unique element in that it could be 
supercooled so far below its melting point. He first collaborated with 
them in measurements of the temperature dependence of the neutron 
structure factor. Tiny globules of the liquid were cushioned in an 
emulsion with deuterated alcohol. The experiment required much patience 
as many samples crystallised before their ultimate limit. Diffraction 
suggested the existence of a fundamental stability limit in the liquid, 
but proof came only with this inelastic experiment. The key to the 
interpretation was the quasi-elastic width at the peak in the structure 
factor which followed linearly to zero at the stability limit. </P></BODY>
