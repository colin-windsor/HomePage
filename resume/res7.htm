<P>Harwell was changing in the seventies with basic research giving way 
to industrial contract research. Characteristically Windsor stood at the 
front of this change, and performed his first contract neutron scattering 
experiments for English China Clays in 1972. He realised that the neutron's 
penetration gave it unique properties for the investigation of actual 
components. During the eighties, he made industrial research his main 
priority and he and the team at Harwell built up a world leadership in 
this field, being invited to give talks to the IAEA[105], in the US[113] 
and in Japan[139]. Looking back over these years it is evident how many 
new research directions were stimulated by his industrial contacts. 
His many contracts with the Cement and Concrete Research Association 
lead Andrew Allen and others at Harwell to take up the scientific study 
of cement especially using small angle neutron scattering [45,81,111]. 
His work for CEGB Berkely on SANS from steels[94,97] is continued to 
this day by Roger Sinclair in work that has now become central to the 
safety cases of reactors.</P>
