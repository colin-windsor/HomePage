</B><P>A contract from the EEC Basic Research in Artificial Intelligence 
and Neural networks (BRAIN) initiative lead to a productive collaboration 
with the group of Eli Beinenstock in Paris. On returning from an extended 
visit there, Windsor wrote a one-dimensional demonstration on his 
home computer to illustrate the improvements he had suggested. 
Andrew Chadwick saw a link with gas chromatography and gave him some 
test data. The method mimics humans by seeking those links which maintain 
local correlations while minimising the distortions mapping one spectrum 
on to the other. Within months the method was working, and arrangements 
being made to patent the method[134]. Two years later the product 
"Harwell Matchfinder" was launched. This product lead to the quite 
new application of signature verification, now patented[144], and 
featured last year on-line in Tomorrow's World.</P></BODY>
