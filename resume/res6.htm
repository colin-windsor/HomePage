<P>In 1975, Windsor and Sinclair wrote an unpublished paper for the joint 
Harwell/Science Research Council Working Group for the proposed New Harwell Linac. It was a 
blueprint for the use of pulsed neutron sources for condensed matter 
science. It discussed the specialities of pulsed neutron sources, 
the comparison with reactors, target and moderator design, and suggested 
a target cell and suite of instruments to surround it. Seven years later, 
by this time of this paper, it had all become a reality. 
It was a busy period. There was the Linac Advisory Committee, 
the Neutron Beam Facilities Committee, the Target Design Group, the 
Moderator Design Group. All the expertise of pulsed neutrons was in 
his head, and he wrote the standard text "Pulsed Neutron Scattering"[75].
