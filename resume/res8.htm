</B><P>A visit to the Welding Institute in 1980 convinced Windsor of the 
commercial importance of residual stress measurement, and he became 
determined to develop a neutron diffraction technique. From his experience 
in fitting diffraction patterns he knew that the key to success was the 
use of large angles. He designed the "double back scattering diffractometer" 
which used the same sample crystal and reflecting plane, say iron 220 planes, 
for both monochromator and specimen. He also designed "the vice", a very 
cheap, but effective device for applying a known strain to a large specimen. 
By the following summer the method was proved and this first publication 
in print. The field has moved from strength to strength with most 
neutron scattering centres having teams in the field, many with dedicated 
instruments. The Harwell team have maintained a leading world role, 
with their publication of the standard reference [109], their recent 
publication of the first book of the subject following the successful 
NATO conference in Oxford in 1991[148, 149], and a succession of 
industrial contracts.</P></BODY>
